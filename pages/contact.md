Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Charlie Chapman and Launched is my podcast where I interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing a creation out into the world.

I recently went through this process myself with the launch of my iOS app Dark Noise and I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release. My hope is that Launched can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.

This is where I need your help. If you are an app developer or creator who has a launch story to tell (or a future launch coming up) I'd love to hear from you! I've created a form to collect applications for coming on the show here.

If this podcast sounds interesting to you, give us a follow on Twitter at @LaunchedFM or my personal account at @_chuckyc. And if you have any ideas or feedback, my DMs are always open!

### Apply to be a Guest
Do you have an app or product launching soon (or already launched) that you'd like to talk about on the show?  Apply using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxduoOnjnF_qE6PpnEGdKewWHvB3YDl0gv3WAxAJ4HDVq8Bg/viewform).

I've gotten a bigger response than I was originally anticipating, so I may not be able to get back to every application.  If you launch another product in the future, don't hesitate to apply again.  My schedule may be more open at that time.
