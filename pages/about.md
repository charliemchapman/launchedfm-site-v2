# About

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Charlie Chapman and Launched is my podcast where I interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing a creation out into the world.

I recently went through this process myself with the launch of my iOS app Dark Noise and I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release. My hope is that Launched can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.

This is where I need your help. If you are an app developer or creator who has a launch story to tell (or a future launch coming up) I'd love to hear from you! I've created a form to collect applications for coming on the show here.

If this podcast sounds interesting to you, give us a follow on Twitter at @LaunchedFM or my personal account at @_chuckyc. And if you have any ideas or feedback, my DMs are always open!
