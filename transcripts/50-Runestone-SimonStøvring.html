<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm Charlie Chapman and today I'm excited to bring you the prolific developer behind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the TechSaver Roombstone.</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Simon Sterling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Simon welcome to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hi.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thanks for having me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've been looking forward to chatting with you today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I'm...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've actually been... I feel like we've been planning this for a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think we...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Roonstone came out earlier this year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and we were starting to plan this episode,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then summer, you know, came barreling down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for me, summer is a kind of like, uh, everything pauses</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because all the families home, and...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I usually pause the show, and so this one ended up getting pushed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's kind of nice, because there's a little more time for Roonstone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of be out in the world. And it ended up being, yeah, you're on kind of a really special</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">episode because you're probably not aware of this because of the way I record this will be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">episode number 50. So I've actually made it to 50 episodes, which it's taken me longer than I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feel like most podcasts do, but that probably fits me pretty well. But I don't know that I would</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have expected that I would have made it this far. So it feels kind of cool. Yeah, I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, congratulations on your 50th episode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's, that's huge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like you've been launching something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at no point intended,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but launching this podcast with great success super fast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I mean, I don't feel like you've been,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you've been that slow at hitting 50.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I don't really know what I'm getting at with this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you know, it's just been so high quality</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from the beginning.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Your podcast that I just think it's just been going great for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I feel like it's been going fast</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it felt like you hit the ground running,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I have just said one, two, 10, and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a great podcast, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, I appreciate that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think I like hacked it a little bit with that weird,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whenever I started it, I released an episode every day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for five days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that helped, you know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Maybe make it appear like I was a little more prolific</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than I actually am, but it feels really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like you're a perfect person to have on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for episode 50.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm excited to get into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And yeah, we've been planning it for a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - So I had a long time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to like, I was about to say prepare,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I don't really think I've prepared that much,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I've had a long time to look forward to this at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Before we get into Roonstone itself then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna give everyone an introduction into who you are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the three questions I always ask to kick off the show</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is where you from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then what was your career like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and apps leading up to Roonstone?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I'm Simon and I live in Denmark in the suburbs of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I grew up in the suburbs many years ago, then I then I moved to Copenhagen and I just recently</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">last year moved back to the suburbs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for those of you who don't know Copenhagen, it's like the capital city of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's the biggest city we have in Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, you're the second Copenhagen person that we've had in the last like I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">five episodes or something because Michael is on recently.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah, you had Michael on earlier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I used to work with Michael, but that's...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh really, that's many years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I live in the suburbs in a small terraced house</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with my girlfriend, we were doing that for a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just enjoying the slow pace of living outside the city.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do have a formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I studied software engineering for five years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back in...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When was this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was like 2011 to 2016.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, must have been it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it just really had to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was always important for me to just have like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted my formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also think like my parents would like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's a good idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I want you to enjoy building software</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that seems to be working out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe having an education is still a good plane.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I always felt the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just tried to rush through it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, as fast as you can, nonetheless.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you were into software development before university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that's what you went into.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like computer science or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To some degree, I feel like I've been doing some kind of software always.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, my dad says I was born and also before I was born.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He was building software and working with hardware and all sorts of software.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, he built back then it was building websites.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He worked with modding different game consoles.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so we had all of these game consoles laying around our house.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when he wasn't modding those, he was building small software projects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I kind of just grew into it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, so you were surrounded by the sort of hacker, like Tinker mentality or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whole life then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My dad's not working with software anymore at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, yeah, he's to some degree, he is actually, but he had a period where he</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wasn't at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But back then everything was like software and hardware in our home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just it always kind of came natural to look into that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So then out of out of university then was the idea like find a firm to work for?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or did you want to do stuff on your own?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like how'd you how'd you get into what you're doing now?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's rewind back a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe before university I went to a gymnasium.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's like basically the Danish equivalent of a high school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, give and take.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, you go there for three years and already back then I was working like small freelance</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gigs for various companies and building my own things on the side. Back then it was like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">websites and back in development. I don't think we called it back in development back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I didn't know that that word. But it was basically what I did. Some things in like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Flash and action script. Oh nice. All that kind of things. And then I got my first iPhone in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">2008 that was the iPhone 3DS. I bought that iPhone because I wanted to develop for it. It wasn't like the other way around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:23.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I did this idea that I wanted to build software that you can touch and like I wanted the best touch screen that I could get back then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To this day I still believe that that was the best touch screen that you could buy for for money basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's kind of how I got into building iPhone and iPad apps. Yeah, and I built my first app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Shortly after I got my first iPhone. I think it was like a year after I mean, I tingered with different things and then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I built my first app and headed on the app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:51.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe half a year a year after. Oh wow. Okay. That was for a Danish. Yeah, that's for Danish music festival</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where like I partnered with them to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the first of all schedule in an inton app that you could have in your pocket and you could like favorite different concerts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like a four day festival or a hundred concerts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you could favorite them and get remind us you know like half an hour before the concerts started and it's like a map of the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Of the whole area and things like that. That was the first I had on the app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you've been playing around with iOS in the app store from basically the beginning</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Not really right. I think the app store wasn't at like three years old back then. This was the iPhone 3.js</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well the the iPhone came out in 2007, but the original iPhone didn't have the app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would have been like right then like 2008 2009 was right whenever the app store came out. I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe I've got the years wrong then wasn't the iPhone 3.js released in 2008</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You would know better than me. I was on the Android train back. Well, maybe back then I wasn't even on a smartphone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it was a while before I was on the Envoyor, the iPhone train.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe I didn't get the year right. I know I got the iPhone model right. Either way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's pretty early days, I would say, either way though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was early days, at least. Yeah, I mean, then I then I went to university,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or started there for five years, still did some freelancing on the side.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:21.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then before I left university, I like, I signed my first contract with the company that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I would then work for and actually still work for to this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now is that iOS development?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that what you're doing for your day job?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started as a, it's an agency called Shape based in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I started there as a student developer in, must have been like 2016, early 2016.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that's that same summer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I finished my studies at the university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just, I went there full time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I had actually had like one year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I was working for another company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was last year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's when we moved out of Copenhagen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we moved to another part of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I thought at the same time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, I'm gonna change my job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I worked there for just short of a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then my old manager contacted me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if I wanted to come back and try something else</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then we made a deal that worked out for both of us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so it sounds like you've been tinkering and making side projects basically your whole</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">life and in the iPhone from pretty early on after university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess if we fast forward a little bit, I feel like maybe this has been the way it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">always been, but by the time I started like noticing your projects and stuff, there was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of this, it felt like you were just constantly coming out with these like sort of developer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:57.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">automation kind of apps. So this is like JSON and data jar and scriptable. In your head, were those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a different thing that kind of started or was that really what you were kind of doing this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whole time? I guess it was like yes and no, it was kind of what I was doing the whole time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I've always had some kind of side project going on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Usually it would be smaller projects that I would just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at the end on and move on to something else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Just trying to figure out like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what do I want to do, what do I enjoy?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Learning new technologies.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that's always been like a huge driver for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when starting a new side project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so when I started scriptable,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that was also part of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found out about this thing called</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the JavaScript call on iOS where I could run JavaScript.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that looked interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And at the same time, so this was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is it four years ago maybe, something like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back in 2018, that's when workflow was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that was quite big back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Workflow, now shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, this thing workflow is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that was like, it was a whole new thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We hadn't seen anything like it in the iOS ecosystem really.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just thought it was super great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was a super fun idea, but it didn't really work for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it had this like, and still to this day as shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has this like a visual language for building your shortcuts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your scripts or whatever you want to call them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And as someone who's been like developing for a long time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that just, it filled a bit cumbersome to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think today I've gotten more used to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can like make some shortcuts, but back then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just felt like it didn't really work for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I thought like, okay, what if I could take</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of the same things that shortcuts can do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, integrating with system frameworks,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the calendar, reminders, the share sheet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of those things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then use this JavaScript call thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">use JavaScript to basically the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I can write small programs,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which for me would be fast or at least,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because that's a different language, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a different language,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">written programming language, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A different visual thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which just like to merely comes more natural.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought that would be a fun challenge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So that started way back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess, so the idea was workflow and shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a bunch of apps kind of in that vein,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even outside of the iOS world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of this like no code concept or whatever. But you were almost, it almost sounds like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your inspiration was like, oh, they have all these hooks into the system and give users</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the ability to write stuff for that. What if we brought it back to code? Yeah. I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it basically gave it a scripting language. Like if you were just going to write a quick</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bash script or something on the Mac. And that was that was sort of the inspiration for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You're starting that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I guess in that sense,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like the old grumpy man</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because of all this no code thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was huge back then and still is very huge today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's even bigger today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can do like many things without coding</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just a tiny bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they were really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they were kind of front runners on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the workflow team, the whole no code thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so in that sense,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like the old grumpy man saying,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, what you're doing is kind of cool,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but what if we still code?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's because they were front-runners</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on two things, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There was like the whole no-code thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then there was this thing of building an app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you used to build something else,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which on iOS was pretty unique.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so in that sense,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they had like, they were unique in two different ways,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the no-code and the hooks into the system.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought the hooks that they had into the system,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the reminders, calendar and so on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they were super intriguing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I just wanted to do things in a way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I were more used to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was like, I don't think I had to fill up any,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">develop tools before that, nothing more than,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, a bash script or my little command line tool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It hadn't really been a thing for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I had, I don't think I had any intentions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to build developer tools back then at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then like since then I found that that's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's something I really enjoy like building tools</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for basically for myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So scriptable was the first one kind of like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was the launch like of that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you releasing it to an audience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it kind of took off right away</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or was it a slow growth to kind of the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like it's a well known, sort of notable app now for people who are sort of power users.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How was the launch back then? I mean, it's four years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:51.860 --> 00:15:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was, uh, I think it kind of, I think I got lucky, honestly, um, because I was just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just building this on my own and I was showing it to people like in,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was showing it to friends and colleagues. I don't really think they understood it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think I understood it myself either.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just like, I remember the first prototype I made.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You could like write a tiny JavaScript</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the first script that I wrote in it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:26.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">only like took as any sentence as input, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a couple of words, then it would split that sentence</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into words and put emojis between the words.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sounds stupid and it was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so it was like, you know, that's just thing on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, it's like a slightly more fancy,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hello world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, basically. So it could do this thing like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sometimes people post a sentence and then they,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then they have the clap emoji between each word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically what I did. And then I showed it to, to my friends and colleagues,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">colleagues and showed them, look how cool this is. And they said,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:01.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you haven't done anything. It's like, no, but imagine the possibilities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. What if 43 wrote another script? And yeah, so,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so like people didn't really get it. And I don't think I really understood it myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">either. So just a started tweeting about it, just hoping to find someone who would think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:22.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this was fun and who could also like point me in some direction saying, oh yeah, this is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if you did this and that? I think I got lucky that I found that on Twitter. Someone who</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">could like point me in some direction and who also thought this was cool. And then I got lucky</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like as the launch was nearing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that Federico Vichitio of Megstore</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is kind of found out about the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and decided to cover it during the launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also I think before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">got onto the beta and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And back then, and that was huge for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And of course, it still is today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If someone would want to cover my apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I mean, I had like, that was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't know anyone in the iOS community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on Twitter or online back then really.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I knew people but I hadn't really talked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or written to anyone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just sent my tweets into this, into the void.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Dark space, yeah, hoping someone would pick it up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and basically that happened.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, I think I got quite lucky</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the launch of Scriptable that it got picked up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by someone without me doing anything else</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than just talking about what I've built.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's basically been my strategy ever since,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you can call it data strategy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You're kind of in an interesting cross-section, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Of like power users who advance enough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that they're gonna wanna write code and JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but also who are going to appreciate</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and wanna do that on iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that like Federico is sort of, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the person who's probably the most prolific</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of writing about that community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and talking about it and everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so the fact that he picked up on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yes, it was like lucky in the sense that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he then could send it to his people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think it's also indicative of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you were making something that that community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be really excited about too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it works both ways, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you really did touch on something where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like everybody talks about even with shortcuts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like it feels really powerful,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but then you run across, you run into these walls.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something like Scriptable is a way to get over those walls.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you see, oh my gosh, there's even more stuff I can do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And since that's come out, you've just kept</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">adding more and more system features, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, back when I started developing Scriptable,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't really, short cause wasn't a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Workflow was a thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that same year, Apple announced that they had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">acquired the Workflow team and at the top,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's so much the same summer that I started Scriptable</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a few months before, they announced that the shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be opened up for developers with this intent,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was it called Intense Back then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe just Siri kid?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, the Intense, Siri kid Intense framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The second that got announced during the Up-Dop,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I immediately pivoted my project to be like a shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">companion, before that that's what's going to make sense now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no intention even before that announcement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of compete with workflow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted to be like, I wanted them to work in parallel somehow,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I hadn't figured out how exactly it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then we had these X-Cault baguels</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I thought maybe I'll just look into that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and find out if I can do something fun with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But when they announced that you can actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hook into shortcuts, it was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"No brainer for me too."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- To turn my app into a shortcuts companion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Since then, you just have kept adding new features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the one that I feel like--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, you've added a bunch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the one that I feel like I saw kind of have another</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">explosion in terms of new people using it and everything was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you added the ability to build your own widgets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I've kind of focused on things that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shortcuts doesn't do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, because I don't really want to compete with it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to be something different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And shortcuts doesn't really have a sense of building UIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">For example, which it's shortcuts doesn't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It has no interactions with widgets as at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought that's like, that's an area for me to explore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, there's been other things where like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have tried to make some just small bridges</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and or APIs in Scriptable that might feel like GAP for someone at least,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's something that shortcuts doesn't do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, if I remember correctly back when I added support for reminders in Scriptable,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shortcuts didn't know anything about remind us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You couldn't work with them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I believe you can today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that was like one of the motivations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for building a reminder speech in scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You kind of want to be the answer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to somebody's Reddit question of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how can I make a do X?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if the system doesn't allow it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you want like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not that you're controlling around Reddit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you want like to be an answer to those problems.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of the same way that you know toolbox pro does that also a bunch of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actions that that shortcuts doesn't support. I believe I mean I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know what the what the developers intentions were but it seems that that must have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">been the intention to like fill some. Yeah he's been on the show actually Alex.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's very much it is he was a power user and wanted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it to do more. Yeah exactly. And then I just I have this twist off I want to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the things in JavaScript, which I think also allows me to support some of the same</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:59.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things that shortcuts do because then I can offer people to do it in JavaScript instead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which some might prefer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you have to underline the whole scriptable is a companion to shortcuts thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:14.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think two years ago I introduced this concept of running a script in line in shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the whole idea with that was that you can have a complex shortcut.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then at some point you might reach, you might have to do a task that either shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">can't do or that that's just easier to do in scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:33.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My own use case for this run in line action in shortcuts, that scriptable offers, is almost</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">always to transform some data.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Doing data manipulation in shortcuts is quite complicated and requires a lot of actions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like mapping a JSON object in JavaScript is almost trivial.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And with this run in line action that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">scriptable offers, we can just provide any object as input,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like maybe any JSON object, or it could also be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other things, and then output the transform object.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From there, you've kind of created a couple more apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that were, I would say, companions to shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like Data Jar is one of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Jay Sans another one, was that sort of in a similar vein, how those came about?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, at least for data giant was, that was always intended as a companion for shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from day one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You would say scriptable wasn't really because it was started before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right, yeah, sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was before shortcuts was a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But data giant very much, and it's still is intended to be a companion for shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I get males from people who want it to do other things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I get support emails from people who wanted to do things that are not really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">strictly shortcuts related.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's just basically a blank no from me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's not really what I want to do with that app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That it's a clear shortcuts companion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, we should say what data jar is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's oh, yeah, you can correct me from wrong, but it's essentially like a way to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">store data in iCloud.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it'll sync between devices, essentially for the purposes of shortcuts, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is a database for shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's basically it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">With JSON, that was a bit different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that for two reasons, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One is that shortcuts got popular on iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And people started building complicated shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that talked with APIs and consumed JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was a bigger need, both for, I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people in the community and also myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to view JSON complex JSON objects on the iPhone and iPad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I wanted to fill that need.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And at the same time, I just found myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:49.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started building JSON shortly after I bought my first iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wasn't sure after shortly before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I knew back then that I wanted to buy an iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I had decided to buy the next one that was released.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hi.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started JSON around that time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I moved some of my work for my data data</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">job to that iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I often have the need to view a JSON document</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or in my data job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was just something that the iPad couldn't really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, there were other apps, but it didn't really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">work that well for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if you open it in any browser on the phone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or on the iPad, it's just going to download it as a text file</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:27.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not like you can get that sort of default view</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you get in Chrome or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- No, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, Chrome has pretty good for support for it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out at the box, that's right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so just felt like if I want to work more on my iPad pro,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like I need this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's basically how that went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So naturally, you build an entire parser</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and syntax highlighting code viewer, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">specifically around JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I didn't really write a pass at first.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that wouldn't be necessary because, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">foundation already has a JSON path or--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, funny thing is, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JSON objects are not by default.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, you shouldn't expect any order in the keys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But when you have a text document</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you view a representation of that text document,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you expect the keys to be in the same order, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - So that's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so I actually had to write my own path</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or to get that behavior.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because Apple's pasta doesn't do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh man, that must have been a horrible realization.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause that was probably the only reason</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">why you needed it then, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The first versions, I don't think they were got</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the app store actually, but the first mighty beta builds,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was testing myself, or just use the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what's it called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, in this JSON serialization or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that worked fine until I realized,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this does a problem here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, this doesn't compare well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- At least, I know from myself when I'm writing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Jason by hand, that will be some logical order of the keys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I might have the ideas the first and name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I wanted my app to do the same</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then it just has to write my own password.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that was a horrible realization</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I would need that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it turned out to be quite simple actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Jason is quite a simple language to pass.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I guess that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, kind of on purpose.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We should clarify too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've been using the terms interchangeably,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but JSON, JSON is the file format,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the app itself is a pun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's JSON, like the name JSON, it's J-A-Y-S-O-N,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is a very good name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- When I chose that name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really, I intended it to be confusing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I thought that would be funny.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Turns out not so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh really? - It's horrible,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, has that caused issues.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It ended up in situations like this and then like when you're talking with people about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're like, yeah, but how do you spill it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is it just JSO and no?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, then it's JA.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JA is ON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, no, that's actually a Y in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's really funny.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, if anybody listening is still confused, there will be a link in the show now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you have that guy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Scriptable feels like that's sort of your almost marquee app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of it being big.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what your actual user numbers are,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it feels like that's the really big one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then data jar and JSON are kind of these shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">companion apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then at some point, you decided you wanted to make</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a full blown code editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So let's get into Runestone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm curious how that came about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">scriptable is definitely like that that's my biggest app. It was also like my first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:05.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that the first day was the first developer tool I built and it kind of got a lot of traction as</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:12.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we already discussed or touched upon briefly at least. Scriptable has a text data. So a big part</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of Scriptable is a text data chart. I mean, I open it. That's the list of the scripts that you have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then you select the script and you either that will either run it or if you press the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">small three dots it will open a text editor and your entire screen will basically be a text view</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which syntax highlighted text and that was built using an open source framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's actually written in JavaScript called highlight.js or highlight or just jas.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't remember exactly and then someone made a wrapper around that to expose it to Swift and I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I use that for a year and I know plenty of other apps use that as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:55.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> So that's just running in the JavaScript engine that you can run in iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:55.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Yeah, it's running JavaScript core.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Then as you mentioned, I also built the JSON app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is also to some degree a TextView or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has a big part of that app is also a TextView.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because there's a visual representation of JSON,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:20.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like that's a kind of a simple text list or that's a symbol list, a UI table view or whatever it's called.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the other side of that is it's a text view with the texture representation of the JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was like this this common thing of dealing with syntax highlighted text in some of my apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:39.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I always thought two things, one, if I want to take these apps to like the next level or if I want to take these text</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">status to the next level, I need to build it on my own. I needed to be more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">performant, I needed to be to do some things that I just can't do with the current</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:55.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">setup and then I thought as well to it might be a fun challenge to build that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">takes the editor. So back in I think was the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:07.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">2020, yeah December 2020 around I think first of December I decided to give</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:13.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">myself a month to build a text editor and just see how far I can get a month of evenings</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:20.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and weekends and then around new year I will kind of revisit if it's a if it's a same decision</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:26.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to yeah to continue down this path and after a month I had gotten pretty far and I thought</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh yeah I'm gonna be done in no time building this text editor and then month went by</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it ended up taking me like oh a half one and a half year to build this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">takes it a tough like not not full-time but of just like evenings and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">weekends. The classic like the last 10% takes 90% of the time or something. Yeah</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">exactly something like that and had a noon it would have taken one and a half</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:58.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">year. I probably would have stopped the project after a month but now I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm super glad that I have built it and I learned a lot during the process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:08.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now I can kind of go back to some of my, uh, my other apps, uh, in particular,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">scriptable and integrate this text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So let's talk about that piece of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you build the text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's an app, Runestone, which is like a plain text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:25.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like the main feature sort of is, you know, it's a nice text editor</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that has syntax highlighting for all these different languages.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But part of this also is you released an open source library,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">also called Runestone, correct?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Yeah, again, intentionally,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">confusing and apparently a bad idea to release an app and a framework</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">under the same name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:50.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what was the idea behind open sourcing that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was always meant to be open source.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I never meant to build an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I never went to build a text editor that should be published on the app store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:05.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So from day one, I wanted to build a framework and I wanted it to be open source.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:11.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Before I started building rooms, I had of course researched if there were other similar frameworks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there were none back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, there were some, but they just, they didn't do what I wanted them to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And some of them weren't like that performance.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's quite difficult to get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shouldn't text highlighting performance</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a text editor on iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sorry, I thought I needed to tackle that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then my thinking was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I need this, if I have a need for an open source</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">text editor, which shouldn't text highlighting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">line numbers and so on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then probably others will need it as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I should open source it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so that was always the idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then of course, when you have an open source framework,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm saying of course, but it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's quite common at least</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you have an open source framework,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you also have an example app that shows</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one, what does this framework do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and two, how can you integrate it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, Roanstone was really just takes out Roanstone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the app was just the example project that back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's how I tested it myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's how I played around with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so the idea was really that you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was more about building the library that you could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then bring into Scriptable or JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the app was just the sample project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no intentions of releasing a standalone text</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the turret, but as I progressed,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as I built features into the framework</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and built them into the example app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just one day looked at it and found that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of built a text to this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so that I wish existed for iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That great text that it was already</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">text test to get great, that's one named code X</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like that different text that it was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then when I had this realization,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I still think to this day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">none of the text editors are using the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what's it called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The UI document browser view controller.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know this component that gives you basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the file sap.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like a file based app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like when you open the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">opens up Finder, or not Finder files.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that's sort of the driving force behind the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I built my same project on that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I mean, I didn't really want to deal with, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">browsing files and having a new document,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then it just found that this is a quite nice way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to browse and open your plain text files.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think it's a good way to--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you receive a text file from Slack</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you save it in the files app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it will automatically appear in their recent--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or I'm saying Slack, you know, it could be from anywhere--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The files that have these ways of surfacing files that you might want to use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that works quite well for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so just I decided to release it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you release Runestone the library and Runestone the app together?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, they were released together back in May.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they were released on the same day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how did that let's I guess let's focus first on the app itself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did that go? Is it received? Well, does there seem like there is kind of a market of people that were looking for something similar?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:29.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that that were I think it was received well for a text editor because in the end, it's just a text editor and it's not it's not like a problem that hasn't been solved on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wish before so it's not like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:37.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It in that sense does does not much novelty. Yeah, it's hard to like tell a story</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of press or getting attention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly. So I think the story that I told was kind of similar to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Subscriptable. I just I tweeted about the development. I was very open about this thing that I built and showed people the progress</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From day one that I started my open source framework and then like throughout throughout the development and then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:05.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At some point I think six months or so after I started developing the open source framework</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found that that I wanted to release this app at some point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:15.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I started that beta and I think the app was actually in beta on test flight for a year, over a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:28.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, throughout that year, I had also like, get out, you know, some kind of audience and people were already using the app and were used to using the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:36.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think just like beta testing an app on test flight is sort of like a soft launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least it can be and I had done that for like a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:48.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when I decided to launch it, I already had some people who could talk kindly about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the app and who had already tried it and who were very kind to know, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tweet and blog about it and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, it just, the launch was quite, it was quite simple actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It felt like I had already, to some degree I felt like I had already launched it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:13.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It just wasn't on the app store. Yeah, it's like less stressful, right? Because yeah, it's not like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:20.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know you've already had so many people looking at it that the at least really obvious rough corners had already been rounded out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:26.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it's there's a little bit less stress that like all these people are gonna see it for the very first time and who knows what you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:32.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Bugs or hidden problems or whatever hiding there. Yeah, yeah exactly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it also means that you can't really do your big bang launch, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:43.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where you're just surprising some people and having a big expression that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:48.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sense. But that was not really my intention. Again, I never really intended to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">build and happen, release it until later. And I didn't really solve a new</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">problem here and so on. So I think this was actually a quite good way to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because it grew the use, it grew the user based slowly and I felt pretty</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">confident with the thing that I actually ended up launching as you mentioned because I already had like I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Had ended up with quite a lot of people on the beta just because I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:17.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was during the same period if I remember correctly that Apple they introduced these public test flight links</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe it was actually a thing before then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think it was the first time that I really tried to pump just for this and I just you know sent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:31.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tweeted those and sent those to people and I didn't set a limit on how many could join</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until a bit later in the process. I think the first few days that were a limit while I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:42.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">smoothing out the raw pages, I didn't want a lot of people on it, but then throughout the beta</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just opened it up to a lot of people. So I ended up with a lot of people on my beta.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:53.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, I definitely think that that's, I understand there's different reasons for different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">choices for people. But for me, having as big of a beta as I can get before, before</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">launch has been really nice. If anything, for my piece of mind, but then also, like you said,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:10.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of like, you know, it builds a little bit of an audience. And if some of those people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">talk to people, they know about it or whatever, that can help make that launch a little bit more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:25.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">more of a thing. I also definitely recommend that you have a bigger beta as you can get basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:31.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because as you mentioned it is really, it is great for your own piece of mind that once you hit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the app store all the rough edges has been smoothed out and I also think it's like it's a pretty</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:44.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">good strategy to launch and solve launch and app these days because as an app developer at least</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found that for me and I think for most others as well, it is quite difficult to get some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:54.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">courage for your app if you're just launching it all through the sudden. There aren't that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">many media writing about apps anymore. There are some and they're doing us all all the developers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A huge framework. That's so kind. But actually having a test right on a big test flight and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">growing an audience before launch is a way to get some some people speaking about your app the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the day that you launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and the thing I've done too is on launch day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll push a test flight update,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's like specific to test flight,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that like pops up a banner, that's basically like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Hey, I'm not taking it away right now."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, this thing came out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be great if you shared this with people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you know, it had links or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, that's a great idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I don't know how effective that really is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's another sort of marketing channel,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least potentially.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's a great idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I never thought of that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's a super good tip.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So that was Runestone the App,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but Runestone the library itself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how did that launch go?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Has it found somewhat of an audience?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Are there people like using it that you know about already?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, it's the first time that I launch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an open source framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really feel like I've put some effort into at least,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I have other small open source frameworks,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but this one I feel like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like probably document it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had a nice read me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a quite complex project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's a big thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so that really felt like launching something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I previously, when I've opened source the project,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it didn't really feel like launching anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like putting something out in the void.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was actually a launch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I had nothing to compare it against.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've never done it before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But people were really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some people were more interested in the project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than I had thought.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I think I once again, I thought that I would launch this out into the world and then maybe in a year or two some people will find it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:57.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, oh, this is this is the framework that I need, you know, randomly, but it turned out that that need that I thought would be there at some point or was maybe a bit bigger than I thought.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:07.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So already from from before I open sourced my project, I had, I had people write to me that they were intending to integrate it into there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And you go to try it out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that a little scary too?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like obviously exciting, but a little bit of pressure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's a lot of pressure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was like super intimidating</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because all of the sudden I knew that there would be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people looking at my coat.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, and yeah, I don't know if that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Actually looking at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I can't know if they're looking at it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but at least I have the opportunity to look at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- If they want to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's super intimidating.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that put a lot of additional stress</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, you know, I was writing a small hack</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or doing something that I knew was a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and oddly work around us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I was like, how am I gonna communicate this to people?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how am I, I'm gonna put this into documentation?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Am I?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I felt like there was a bit more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was, yeah, I felt like it was a bit more intimidating.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it was, at the same time, it was super nice to know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that there would be people who were interested.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it wasn't just something that I believed, but that I had like tangible proof, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just inform, just as you know messages and so on, that the people were interested in it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to some degree. I actually, I had, I did a small beta of the open source framework as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I contacted some of these people that have told me that they wanted to integrate it and just had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:35.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">them play around with it for, I think a week or two before I open sourced it. Again, just to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">smooth out the edges and give myself a chance to receive some of the like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of the questions that people would just have on day one have those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">answered if I could um right exactly so you're prepared on it with a smaller group size</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah exactly but yeah then when I open-sourced it it turned out like I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:02.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just a few weeks later that the first apps were out that that were using it besides my own</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, that's cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was super cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then after a few months,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of the mobile team from GitHub wrote me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that they were integrating it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's also super cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it has been, it has been going,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quite good for the old Microsoft framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, seriously, that's like the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's kind of the ultimate, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, how many people are viewing code</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in or editing code in the GitHub app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's gotta be one of the bigger iOS apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in existence for people doing that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, probably, I mean, I don't know the user base,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I do remember like a year ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I was talking with some of my friends,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like, wow, I'm sourcing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What do you imagine?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I said nothing, but I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it would be cool if someone like GitHub would use it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I remember myself saying that sense</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and not really believing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then to this day day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to start that day day hour,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or that's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's so cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sweet, well, I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's been fun watching you do this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And actually, I don't know if you wanna talk about it at all,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I feel like you're in the midst of essentially</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one of these stories again right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You are yet again building something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that seems kind of crazy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It doesn't even have a name yet, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:30.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is your like JavaScript to SwiftUI project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're building?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, that is the name right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, of course, one day I might like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">snow secret, if this project like goes well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it would be natural to integrate it into scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or yeah, that would make sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:52.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess that's like the long term goal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right now it is like an exploration of what else can I do in the space of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JavaScript, um,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:06.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JavaScript bridge to Swift. That was like the idea of scriptable, right? JavaScript bridge to Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or actually the other way around, right? Swift frameworks and API.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So JavaScript. Right. Yeah. That's the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:24.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then tying a little into what we briefly touched upon earlier, shortcuts doesn't really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have this sense of building UIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought it would be fun to investigate and research if it's possible to bridge Swift</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">UIs to JavaScript through JavaScript Core.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:45.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's a project that I think again it started like a year ago and then it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">been like just you know sitting on a shelf as I as I wrapped up rooms don't but then now that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">rooms don't just like out and lives and as it has its own life I've kind of picked up this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">project again and made some progress. I was just going to say if any like if these stories of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Simon talking about building these things and talking about it online if that sounds interesting to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you you have a chance to watch them do it right now like it has been really fun watching my Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:16.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And often just being like, oh my gosh, this guy is very brave.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:22.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You are, you are like definitely becoming the master of JavaScript and the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">intersection of JavaScript and Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:29.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's so much fun watching you in these phases where you're clearly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very excited about something technical.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you don't quite know exactly where it's all going to land yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're just discovering and being very, very open and talking about it constantly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was really fun watching you do that with Rynstone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's been fun watching you do that in, I didn't see the beginning of it, but with scriptable,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's been lots of phases of it that have been fun. And I kind of feel like I'm watching it again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:55.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this with this project right now, which who knows if it'll go anywhere, but it's a fun journey</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:01.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to watch either way. Yeah, sure. I'm super glad to hear that. I really enjoy building things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the OOM as they say. I think it's just a fun way to build software because you get a lot of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:14.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">inputs and especially with this project of like switching SwiftUI to JavaScript, two parts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I know very little about like I don't have much experience with SwiftUI and I certainly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:25.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">don't have much experience writing like production ready JavaScript. So it's just fun to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:31.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">put it out there and here I get some feedback from both sides. I've gotten some really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:39.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">really valuable feedback from both sides and that has shaped the product or the project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the APIs that I'm working with these days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:50.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's true for this JavaScript to SwiftUI project, like the other way around really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on how you look at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's true for that project and it was also true for scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then I had like zero notes of JavaScript other than just fiddling around with my own</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:11.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">CLI's written in Node.js, but I didn't really know what would work in the JavaScript world in terms of API's.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:16.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if people can, I definitely recommend building things in the room.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also understand that some people want to keep their projects a secret, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's never really been my thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Before we wrap up, I do want to ask you the question that I ask everybody at the end of the show,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is what's a person or people out there that have inspired you and your work that you'd</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:42.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">recommend others check out? Yeah, this was a sure hard one to prepare for. Because I don't really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:48.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't feel like I can point at one person or any person really, and that's not to say that no</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one is inspiring me. It's right to say that there are lots of people. It's not like I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:53.620 --> 00:51:00.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really have one person where I feel like this person is like that's who I want to be a day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Inspire me. Yeah. Yeah. It's more like something that they do so like if you asked me if you ask me this question</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">10 years ago, I would say that anyone who lives off or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:17.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Who can make a living of making iOS apps day inspire me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you asked me 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I would say anyone who makes a living of making</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Software they inspire me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like it's always something people do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I can like I can dive into this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And have like these periods of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:41.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Throughout a year where that's like where it is like one specific person was by other</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's that's again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:47.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's because of something really specific that they've done. I remember like earlier this year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was a person named Mark Seaman,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who's been very vocal about design patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and challenging some of the design patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">presented by Martin Fowler.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I had a month where I just dive deep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into the work of Mark Seaman</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and everyone who would hear me talk about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would just talk with them about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, do you know this guy, my name Mark Seaman?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And he does this and that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's like, that's again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for some very particular things that he made</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I really believe then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I still have it to this day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, you're an inspiration to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for doing this podcast and like Christian C,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:30.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like for doing these like funny things in his apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like this pixel pile thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like making that work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that really inspires me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's like, that's something that I hope</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do with my apps one day as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, can I make a serious app somehow?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then making this like, fun twist on top of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is also technically challenging</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like impressive from a technical perspective,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though it's, yeah, this like goofy, delightful thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">embedded in an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's definitely not easy to do what Christian did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, so it's difficult to point at particular persons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess I did that anyways,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's like, I feel like every day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a new person because then it tweets something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I'm like, "Oh, this is super cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna do what they have done."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's almost like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's almost like the answer is the community, in a sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it feels weird on this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Today is November 15th.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So at this point at least Twitter is still alive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:40.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so Twitter, that sort of world of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are openly talking about the things that they build,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is something I found in the iOS community in particular, really inspiring, is like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of people talking about what they're working on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I came from the web world, and lots of people talk openly about technical things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:01.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're working on, but the product side and all of the different pieces all coming together</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and people being really open about that, the iOS community in general, for whatever reason,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has this sort of general vibe of people just being really open</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and talking a lot about what they're doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I find the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I could have a list, well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could have a list 50 people long.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">As this podcast maybe shows of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who like been big inspirations for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like you said, it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are times when I'm really into a particular person,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:38.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like recently Daniel Goethe with Up Ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I just want everything about that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to be things that I'm doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I've had lots of people, you know, my career,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or throughout my iOS time that have been like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can probably see pieces of all that in my app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like a tapestry of these different people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have been obsessed with over time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, Up Ahead, that's really a great app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:02.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to time to talk</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about things like Twitter and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they are always community because,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as you mentioned, yeah, Twitter is still alive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know about you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I haven't checked it within the last one and a half hour</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while we've been chatting, but--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, it might not be where we should have done that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I think you have a good point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, it's a good way of phrasing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The ones you just had,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like saying that the iOS community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is their inspiration here because that is like that is a community that I don't believe you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:42.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">find something you might find something like it but you don't find something exactly like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:50.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in for many other platforms I have some friends who like build apps for Android yeah I have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">friends who build apps for Android and they're like looking at the Irish community saying that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:00.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that there is something special here that they feel like they're missing out on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:04.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Of course, they're also going to conference conferences and meeting people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:10.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think we have the benefit when we meet in real life, we've usually talked before that on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we're like, "Yeah."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It feels like people already know each other somehow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think you have that feeling in many other communities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that is because we share a lot of our work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's just like, it's a difficult thing to talk about because like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">followed in a week we might not have this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe it's on another platform or yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, the good news is the people, the people are there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:40.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That I, you know, I wasn't part of the Apple development community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:45.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until more recently, but like I've talked to a lot of people who have been.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And a lot of people talk about like panic and the sort of delicious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app generation as a similar kind of feel.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They didn't have Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:53.860 --> 00:57:01.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think I hope that the community exists if, for whatever reason, Twitter isn't where they live.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:10.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really hope that they still can find a place to continue that sort of tradition of sharing and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being quirky and making fun delightful things for the sake of making fun delightful things and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and inspiring each other in some way. So yeah, we'll see where it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that was the time before Twitter and of course there'll be a time after Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But let's see, I mean, maybe Twitter will still be a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I hope, I mean, I've tweeted that before and I'll mention it again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:39.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll be the last person to leave, not because I endorse all the things that are going on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but just because it's like, it's where people are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:47.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's where I get a lot of my news, at least my tech news.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:50.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like, it's just the place to be right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yep, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:58.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm definitely scrambling around and trying to build any social graphs I can in other places,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just in case.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:06.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for now anyway, I really hope that it stays as Twitter and things stabilize in whatever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">form that that needs to take.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:12.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That isn't hopefully a bad thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But we'll see how it goes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't wanna end on a sad note though,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because Twitter, as long as it's still here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're gonna be tweeting about the crazy projects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bringing JavaScript and Swift together.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so definitely check that out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And where should people go to find that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and any other projects that you're working on?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I think the best place to find me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is on Twitter right now when @SimonBS</p>
