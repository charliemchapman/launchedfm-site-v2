<p class="time-stamp">00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm Charlie Chapman.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And today, I'm excited to bring you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the prolific developer behind the text editor RuneStone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Simon Sterling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Simon, welcome to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hi.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thanks for having me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">been looking forward to chatting with you today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I'm, I'm, we've actually been, I feel like we've been planning this for a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think we, RuneStone came out earlier this year, and we were starting to plan this episode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then summer, you know, came barreling down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for me, summer is a kind of like, everything pauses because all the family's home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I usually pause the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so this one ended up getting pushed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's kind of nice, because there's a little more time for RuneStone to kind of be out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the world and it ended up being,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You're on kind of a really special episode</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because you're probably not aware of this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause of the way I record.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This will be episode number 50.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've actually made it to 50 episodes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which it's taken me longer than I feel like most podcasts do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that probably fits me pretty well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't know that I would have expected</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would have made it this far.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it feels kind of cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, well, congratulations on your 50th episode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's huge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I don't know. I feel like you've been launching something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">no pun intended, but launching this podcast with great success, super fast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I don't feel like you've been that slow at hitting 50.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I don't really know where I'm getting at with this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's just been so high quality from the beginning,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your podcast, that I just think it's just been going great for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I feel like it's been going fast because you just...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It felt like you hit the ground running with your episode 1 to 10 and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a great podcast, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I appreciate that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think I like hacked a little bit with that weird whenever I started it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I released an episode every day for five days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that helped, you know, maybe make it appear like I was a little more prolific than I actually am.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it feels really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like you're a perfect person to have on for episode 50.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm excited to get into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, we've been planning it for a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I had a long time to like, I was about to say prepare,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I don't really think I've prepared that much,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I've had a long time to look forward to this at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Before we get into RuneStone itself then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna give everyone an introduction into who you are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the three questions I always ask to kick off the show</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is where are you from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then what was your career like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and apps leading up to RuneStone?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so I'm Simon and I live in Denmark</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the suburbs of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I grew up in the suburbs many years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I, then I moved to Copenhagen and I just recently last year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">moved back to the suburbs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for those of you who don't know, Copenhagen is like the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">capital city of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's so that that's the biggest city we have in Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're like the, you're the second Copenhagen person that we've had in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">last, like, I don't know, five episodes or something, because Michael was on recently.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You had, you had Michael on earlier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I used to work with Michael, but that's.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh really?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's many years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I live in the suburbs in a small terraced house with my girlfriend.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've been doing that for a year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just enjoying the slow pace of living outside the city.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's great. I do have a formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I studied software engineering for five years back in...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When was this? That was like 2011 to 2016.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, must have been it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I just really had to...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was always important for me to just have like, I wanted my formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also think like my parents were like, "Ah, that's a good idea, Simon."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Even though, you know, you enjoy building software and that seems to be working out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe having a new education is still a good plan.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I always felt the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just tried to rush through it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, as fast as you can, nonetheless.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you were into, so you were into software development before university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that's what you went into. It's like computer science or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To some degree, I feel like I've been doing some kind of software always. I mean, my dad,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since I was born, and also before I was born, he was building software and working with hardware</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all sorts of ways. I mean, he built back then it was building websites. He worked with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">modding different game consoles. And so we had all of these game consoles laying around our house.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And when he wasn't modding those, he was building like small software projects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, just, I kind of just grew into it, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you were surrounded by the sort of hacker, like tinker</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mentality your whole life then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My dad's not working with software anymore at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, yeah, he is to some degree he is actually, but he had a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">period where he wasn't at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But back then everything was like software and hardware in our home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just, it always kind of came natural to look into that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So then out of out of university, then was the idea like find a firm to work for?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or did you want to do stuff on your own?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how'd you how'd you get into what you're doing now?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's rewind back a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe before university, I went to a gymnasium.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's like basically the Danish equivalent of a high school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">OK, give and take.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, you go there for three years and already back then I was working like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">small freelance gigs for various companies and building my own things on the side.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then it was like websites and backend development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think we called it backend development back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I didn't know that word,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that was basically what I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some things in like Flash and ActionScript.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- All that kind of things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I got my first iPhone in 2008.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was the iPhone 3GS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I bought that iPhone because I wanted to develop for it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't like the other way around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I wanted to build software that you can touch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I wanted the best touchscreen that I could get back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To this day, I still believe that that was the best touchscreen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you could buy for money, basically.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's kind of how I got into building iPhone and iPad apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I built my first app shortly after I got my first iPhone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it was like a year after.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I tinkered with different things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then I built my first app and had it on the App Store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe half a year or a year after.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, wow. Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was for a Danish music festival,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I partnered with them to build the festival schedule into an app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you could have it in your pocket,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you could favorite different concerts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like a four-day festival with 100 concerts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you could favorite them and get reminders</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">half an hour before the concert started.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then. It's like a map of the whole area and things like that. That was the first app I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had on the App Store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you've been playing around with iOS and the App Store from basically the beginning?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Not really, right? I think the App Store, wasn't it like three years old back then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This was the iPhone 3GS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, the iPhone came out in 2007, but the original iPhone didn't have the App Store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would have been like right then, like 2008, 2009 was right whenever the App Store came</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe I've got the years wrong then. Wasn't the iPhone 3 just released in 2008?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You would know better than me. I was on the Android train back...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, maybe back then I wasn't even on a smartphone, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was a while before I was on the Android... or the iPhone train.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe I didn't get the year right. I know I got the iPhone model right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Either way, that's pretty early days, I would say. Either way, though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was early days, at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, then I went to university,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I studied there for five years, still did some freelancing on the side.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:21.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then before I left university, I signed my first contract with the company that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would then work for and actually still work for to this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now, is that iOS development?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that what you're doing for your day job?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started as...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an agency called Shape based in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I started there as a student developer in...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It must have been like early 2016.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that same summer, I finished my studies at the university</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I went there full-time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I had actually had one year where I was working for another company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was last year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's when we moved out of Copenhagen and we moved to another part of Denmark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I thought at the same time, you know, I'm going to change my job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I worked there for just short of a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then then my old manager contacted me, like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I wanted to come back and try something else and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then, yeah, then we made a deal that that worked out for both of us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nice. OK, so it sounds like you've been tinkering and making side projects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">basically your whole life and in the iPhone from pretty early on after university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess if we like fast forward a little bit, I feel like maybe this has been the way it's always been.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But by the time I started, like noticing your projects and stuff, there was sort of this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It felt like you were just constantly coming out with these like sort of developer automation kind of apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this is like JSON and data jar and scriptable in your head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">were those like a different thing that kind of started?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or was that really what you were kind of doing this whole time?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it was like, yes and no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was kind of what I was doing the whole time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I've always had like some kind of side project going on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Usually it would be smaller projects that I would just like abandon</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and move on to something else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just trying to figure out like, what do I want to do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What do I enjoy?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Learning new technologies.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that's always been a huge driver for me when starting a new side project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so when I started Scriptable, I think that was also part of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found out about this thing called JavaScript Core on iOS,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I could run JavaScript.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that looked interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And at the same time, this was like, is it four years ago, maybe?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Something like that, back in 2018.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's when Workflow was like, that was quite big back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:01.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">workflow. Now, shortcuts. I was like, "This thing, workflow, is great."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that was like a whole new thing. We hadn't seen anything like it in the iOS ecosystem,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">really. And I just thought it was super great. It was a super fun idea, but it didn't really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">work for me because it had this like... And still to this day, as shortcuts has this like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">visual language for building your shortcuts, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Your scripts or whatever you want to call them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And as someone who's been developing for a long time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it felt a bit cumbersome to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think today I've gotten more used to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can make some shortcuts, but back then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it just felt like it didn't really work for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I thought, "Okay, what if I could take</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of the same things that shortcuts can do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">integrating with system frameworks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the calendar, reminders, the share sheet, all of those things, and then use this JavaScript</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">core thing, use JavaScript to do basically the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then I can write small programs, which for me would be faster at least, because that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a different language, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a written programming language rather than this visual thing, which just to me at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">least comes more natural.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought that would be a fun challenge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that started way back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:25.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the idea was workflow and shortcuts and a bunch of apps kind of in that vein, even</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">outside of the iOS world, they're kind of this like no code concept or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you were almost, it almost sounds like your inspiration was like, oh, they have all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these hooks into the system and give users the ability to write stuff for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if we brought it back to code?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, it basically gave it a scripting language, like if you were just going to write</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a quick bash script or something on the Mac. And that was that was sort of the inspiration</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for starting that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, I guess in that sense, I was like the old grumpy man. Because of course, this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">no code thing was huge back then and still is very huge today. I think it's even bigger</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:11.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">today, and you can do many things without coding just a tiny bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think they were kind of frontrunners on that, the workflow team, the whole no code</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, I was like the old Grumpy Man saying, "Yeah, what you're doing is kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of cool, but what if we still code?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's because they were frontrunners on two things, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There was the whole no code thing, and then there was this thing of building an app that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">used to build something else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which on iOS was pretty unique.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, they were unique in two different ways, the no code and the hooks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into the system.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought the hooks that they had into the system, the reminders calendar and so on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they were super intriguing, but I just wanted to do things in a way that I was more used</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:08.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was like, I don't think I had developed any developer tools before that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:14.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nothing more than a bash script or my own little command line tool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It hadn't really been a thing for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think I had any intentions to build developer tools back then, at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then since then, I found that that's something I really enjoy, building tools basically for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So Scriptable was the first one kind of like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was the launch like of that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you releasing it to an audience and it kind of took off right away?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or was it a slow growth to kind of the...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like it's a well-known sort of notable app now for people who are sort of power users.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How was the launch back then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it's four years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:03.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was... I think I got lucky, honestly, because I was just building this on my own</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I was showing it to people, I was showing it to friends and colleagues</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who I don't really think they understood it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think I understood it myself either.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:19.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I remember the first prototype I made, you could write a tiny JavaScript</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the first script that I wrote in it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it only took any sentence as input,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, a couple of words,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then it would split that sentence into words</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and put emojis between the words.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sounds stupid and it was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it was like, you know, there's this thing on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, it's like a slightly more fancy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Hello, world."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, basically.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it could do this thing, like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sometimes people post a sentence</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then they have the clap emoji between each word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's basically what I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I showed it to my friends and colleagues and showed them, "Look how cool this is."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they said, "But you haven't done anything."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, "No, but imagine the possibilities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if we wrote another script?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so people didn't really get it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think I really understood it myself either.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:16.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just started tweeting about it, just hoping to find someone who would think this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was fun and who could also point me in some direction,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">saying, "Oh yeah, this is great. What if you did this and that?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I got lucky that I found that on Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">someone who could point me in some direction</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and who also thought this was cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I got lucky again, as the launch was nearing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that Federico Vecchietti of MagStories</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of found out about the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and decided to cover it during the launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and also, I think before, got onto the beta and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And back then, that was huge for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And of course, it still is today, if someone wants to cover my apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, I mean, I had...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, that was... I didn't know anyone in the iOS community</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on Twitter or online back then, really.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I knew people, but I hadn't really talked or written to anyone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just sent my tweets into, you know, this...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Into the void.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Dark space, yeah, hoping someone would pick it up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And basically that happened.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, I think I got quite lucky with the launch of Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That it got picked up by someone without me doing anything else</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than just talking about what I've built.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's basically been my strategy ever since.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you can call that a strategy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're kind of in an interesting cross-section, right,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like power users who advanced enough that they're going to want to write code in JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:55.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but also who are going to appreciate and want to do that on iOS. Yeah. And that like Federico is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:01.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of, you know, the person who's probably the most prolific in terms of writing about that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">community and, and talking about it and everything. And so the fact that he picked up on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes, it was like lucky in the sense that, you know, he then could send it to his people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think it's also indicative of like, you were making something that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that community would be really excited about to like, it works both ways, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you really did touch on something where, like, everybody talks about even with shortcuts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like, it feels really powerful. But then you run across you run into these walls,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something like scriptable is like a way to get over those walls. And then you kind of see,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh my gosh, there's even more stuff I can do."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And since that's come out, you've just kind of kept adding more and more system features, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Back when I started developing Scriptable, I didn't really... Shortcuts wasn't a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Workflow was a thing, right? But that same year, Apple announced that they had acquired the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">workflow team. And at DubDub that summer, they announced that the same summer that I started</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Scriptable a few months before, they announced that the shortcuts would be like opened up for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for developers with this, was it called Intents back then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe just SiriKit?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the SiriKit Intents framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The second that got announced during DubDub,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I immediately pivoted my project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to be like a shortcuts companion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that that's what's gonna make sense now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no intention even before that announcement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of compete with workflow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted them to work in parallel somehow,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I hadn't figured out how exactly yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then we had these X callback URLs,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I thought maybe I'll just look into that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and find out if I can do something fun with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But when they announced</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you can actually hook into Shortcuts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was like a no-brainer for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to turn my app into a Shortcuts companion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Since then, you just have kept adding new features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the one that I feel like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, you've added a bunch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the one that I feel like I saw kind of have another explosion</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of new people using it and everything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was when you added the ability to build your own widgets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've kind of focused on things that Shortcuts doesn't do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, because I don't really want to compete with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to be something different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And Shortcuts doesn't really have a sense of building UIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">For example, Shortcuts doesn't...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, it has no interactions with widgets at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought that's an area for me to explore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, there's been other things where like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have tried to make some just small bridges</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or APIs inscriptable that might fill a gap</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for someone at least, because it's something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that Shortcuts doesn't do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, if I remember correctly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">back when I added support for Reminders inscriptable,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Shortcuts didn't know anything about Reminders.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You couldn't work with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I believe you can today, but that was one of the motivations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for building a reminder script in Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You kind of want to be the answer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to somebody's Reddit question of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"How can I make it do X?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if the system doesn't allow it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you want, not that you're trolling around Reddit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you want to be an answer to those problems.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Kind of the same way that Toolbox Pro does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:29.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's also a bunch of actions that Shortcuts doesn't support. I believe, I mean, I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know what the developers' intentions were, but it seems that that must have been the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">intention to like fill some…</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, he's been on the show, actually, Alex.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's very much it. He was a power user and wanted it to do more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:49.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly. And then I just, I have this twist of, I want to do the things in JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I think also allows me to support some of the same things that shortcuts do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because then I can offer people to do it in JavaScript instead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which some might prefer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you have to underline the whole scriptable is a companion to shortcuts thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think two years ago, I introduced this concept</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of running a script inline in shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the whole idea with that was that you can have a complex shortcut,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then at some point, you might have to do a task</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that either Shortcuts can't do or that's just easier to do in Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My own use case for this run inline action in Shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that Scriptable offers is almost always to transform some data.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Doing data manipulation in Shortcuts is quite complicated</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and requires a lot of actions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But mapping a JSON object in JavaScript is almost trivial.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And with this running line action that Scriptable offers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can just provide any object as input,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or maybe any JSON object, or it could also be other things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then output the transformed object.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From there, you've kind of created a couple more apps that were,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would say, companions to shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like DataJar is one of them, JSON's another one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Was that sort of in a similar vein, how those came about?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, at least for DataGuard, that was always intended as a companion for shortcuts from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like day one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can say it's scriptable, it wasn't really because it was started before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right, yeah, true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Before shortcuts was a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But DataGuard very much, and it still is intended to be a companion for shortcuts to this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I get mails from people who wanted to do other things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I get support emails from people who wanted to do things that are not really strictly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shortcuts related.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's just basically a blank no from me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's not really what I want to do with that app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is a clear shortcuts companion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We should say what Data Jar is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's essentially like a way to store data in iCloud</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so it'll sync between devices, essentially for the purposes of shortcuts, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is a database for shortcuts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's basically it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">With JSON, that was a bit different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that for two reasons, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:23.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One is that shortcuts got popular on iOS and people started building complicated shortcuts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that talked with APIs and consumed JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there was a bigger need both for people in the community and also myself to view JSON,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">complex JSON objects on the iPhone or iPad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I wanted to fill that need.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:47.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And at the same time, I just found myself, I think I started building JSON shortly after</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I bought my first iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wasn't shortly after, I was shortly before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I knew back then that I wanted to buy an iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I had decided to buy the next one that was released.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started JSON around that time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:06.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I moved some of my work for my day-to-day job to that iPad Pro.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:13.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I often have the need to view a JSON document in my day job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was just something that the iPad couldn't really do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, there were other apps, but it didn't really work that well for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's true. Because if you open it in any browser on the phone or on the iPad,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just going to download it as a text file or something, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not like you can get that sort of default view that you get in Chrome or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, exactly. Yeah, Chrome has pretty good support for it out of the box.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the box. That's right. Yes, I just felt like if I want to work more on my iPad Pro, I feel</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I need this thing. So that's basically how that went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:55.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So naturally, you build an entire parser and syntax highlighting, like code viewer, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">specifically around JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't really write a parser at first. I thought that wouldn't be necessary because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, Foundation already has a JSON parser.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah, that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, funny thing is, you know, JSON objects are unordered by default.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, you shouldn't expect any order in the keys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But when you have a text document and you view a representation of that text document,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you expect the keys to be in the same order, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I actually had to write my own parser to get that behavior because Apple's parser doesn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh man, that must have been a horrible realization.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because that was probably the only reason why you needed it then, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The first versions, I don't think they ever got to the App Store, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the first many beta builds I was testing myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just used the, what's it called, like, NSJSON serialization or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that worked fine until I realized,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"There's a problem here. I mean, this doesn't compare well."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:05.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">As often, at least, I know for myself, when I'm writing JSON by hand,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there will be some logical order of the keys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I might have the IDs, the first and name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I wanted my app to do the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then it just has to write my own parser.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that was a horrible realization that I would need that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it turned out to be quite simple, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JSON is quite a simple language to parse.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, kind of on purpose.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:35.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We should clarify too, we've been using the terms interchangeably, but JSON, J-S-O-N,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:45.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is the file format, but the app itself is a pun. It's J-A-S-O-N, like the name, Jason. It's J-A-Y-S-O-N,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is a very good name. When I chose that name, I intended it to be confusing because I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thought that would be funny. Turns out not so much. That was a horrible idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Has that caused issues?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You end up in situations like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then when you're talking with people about it, they're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Yeah, but how do you spell it? Is it just J-S-O-N? No.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, then it's J-A-S-O-N? No, no, that's actually a Y in there."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's really funny.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, if anybody listening is still confused,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there will be a link in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so you have that guy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Scriptable feels like that's sort of your almost marquee app in terms of it being big. I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what your actual user numbers are, but it feels like that's the really big one. And then DataJar</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and JSON are kind of these shortcuts, companion apps. And then at some point, you decided you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wanted to make like a full-blown code editor. So let's get into Runestone. And I'm curious how that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that came about?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Scriptable is definitely like, that's my biggest app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was also like my first,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:03.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that the first, it was the first developer tool I built</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it kind of got a lot of traction</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as we already discussed, or touched upon briefly at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Scriptable has a text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A big part of Scriptable is a text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, when you open it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a list of the scripts that you have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then you select a script and that will either run it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or if you press the small three dots,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it will open a text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And your entire screen will basically be a text view</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with syntax highlighted text.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was built using an open source framework</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's actually written in JavaScript</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">called Highlight.js or HighlightR.js.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't remember exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then someone made a wrapper around that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to expose it to Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I used that for years</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I know plenty of other apps use that as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So that's just running in the JavaScript engine</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you can run in iOS?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's running in JavaScript Core, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then as you mentioned, I also built the JSON app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is also, to some degree, a text view,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or has at least a big part of that app is also a text view,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause there's a visual representation of JSON,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as like that's a kind of a simple text list,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sorry, that's a simple list or UI table view or whatever it's called.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the other side of that is a text view</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the textual representation of the JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was like this common thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of dealing with syntax highlighted text in some of my apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I always thought two things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One, if I want to take these apps to the next level,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or if I want to take these text editors to the next level,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to build it on my own.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I needed to be more performant, I needed to do some things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I just can't do with the current setup.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I thought, as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it might be a fun challenge to build a text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So back in, I think, must have been 2020,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, December 2020, around, I think, 1st of December,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I decided to give myself a month to build a text editor</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just see how far I can get a month of evenings and weekends.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then around New Year, I will kind of revisit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if it's a sane decision to continue down this path.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And after a month, I had gotten pretty far.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I thought, "Oh yeah, I'm going to be done in no time building this text editor."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then months went by and it ended up taking me like over one and a half year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to build this text editor of like, not full-time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but of just evenings and weekends.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The classic, like, the last 10% takes 90% of the time or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly. Something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And had I known it would have taken one and a half years,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I probably would have stopped the project after a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But now I'm super glad that I have built it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I learned a lot during the process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now I can kind of go back to some of my other apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in particular, scriptable and integrate this text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so let's talk about that piece of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you built a text editor that's an app, Runestone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like a plain text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like the main feature sort of is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, it's a nice text editor that has syntax highlighting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for all these different languages.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:35.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But part of this also is you released an open source library</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">also called Runestone, correct?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, again, intentionally confusing and apparently a bad idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to release an app and a framework under the same name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what was the idea behind open sourcing that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was always meant to be open source.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I never meant to build an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least I never meant to build a text editor that should be published on the App Store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So from day one, I wanted to build a framework and I wanted it to be open source.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">before I started building RuneStone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had of course researched if there were other similar frameworks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there were none back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, there were some, but they just didn't do what I wanted them to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And some of them weren't that performant.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's quite difficult to get syntax highlighting performant</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a text editor on iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought I needed to tackle that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then my thinking was, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If I have a need for an open-source text editor</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and so on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then probably others will need it as well, so I should open-source it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so that was always the idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then, of course, when you have an open-source framework...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm saying "of course," but it's quite common, at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When you have an open-source framework, you also have an example app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that shows, one, what does this framework do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and two, how can you integrate it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So RuneStone was really just the example project back then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's how I tested it myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's how I played around with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so the idea was really that you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was more about building the library</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you could then bring into Scriptable or JSON.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the app was just the sample project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Huh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no intentions of releasing a standalone text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But as I progressed, as I built features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into the framework and build them into the example app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:37.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just one day looked at it and found that I kind of built a text editor</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I wish existed for iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There are great text editors already.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Textastic is great. There's one named Codex.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there are different text editors.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then, when I had this realization, and I still think to this day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">none of the text editors are using the...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What's it called? The UI document browser view controller.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, this component that gives you basically the files app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like a file-based app. Like when you open the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:12.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it opens up Finder, or not Finder, files. And yeah, that's sort of the driving force</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">behind the app. Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I built my example project on that because, I mean, I didn't really want to deal with,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, browsing files and having a document picker and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I just found that this is a quite nice way to browse</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and open your plain text files.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's a good way to...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you receive a text file from Slack and you save it in the Files app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it will automatically appear under Recent or...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm saying Slack, it could be from anywhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The Files app has these ways of surfacing files that you might want to use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that works quite well for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I decided to release it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:02.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you release RuneStone the library and RuneStone the app together?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, they were released together back in May.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they were released on the same day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how did that... I guess let's focus first on the app itself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did that go? Was it received well?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Does there seem like there was kind of a market of people that were looking for something similar?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think it was received well for a text editor</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because in the end, it's just a text editor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's not a problem that hasn't been solved on iOS before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's not like...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In that sense, there's not much novelty.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:40.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's hard to tell a story in terms of press or getting attention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly. So I think the story that I told was kind of similar to Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just tweeted about the development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was very open about this thing that I built and showed people the progress</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from day one that I started my open-source framework,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then throughout the development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then at some point, I think six months or so</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">after I started developing the open-source framework,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found that I wanted to release this app at some point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I started a beta.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think the app was actually in beta on TestFlight for a year, over a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:24.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And throughout that year, I had also gathered some kind of audience and people were already</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">using the app and were used to using the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think just beta testing an app on TestFlight is sort of like a soft launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least it can be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I had done that for a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:48.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when I decided to launch it, I already had some people who could talk kindly about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:55.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the app and who had already tried it and who are very kind to tweet and blog about it and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So in that sense, the launch was quite simple, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I felt like I had already, to some degree, I felt like I had already launched it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It just wasn't on the app store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's less stressful, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because it's not like...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You've already had so many people looking at it that the at least really obvious rough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">corners had already been rounded out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so there's a little bit less stress that all these people are going to see it for the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very first time and who knows what bugs or hidden problems or whatever are hiding there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It also means that you can't really do your big bang launch, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you're just surprising some people and having a big splash in that sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that was not really my intention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I never really intended to build an app and release it until later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I didn't really solve a new problem here and so on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think this was actually a quite good way to do it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it grew the user base slowly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I felt pretty confident with the thing that I actually ended up launching,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as you mentioned, because I already had...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I ended up with quite a lot of people on the beta,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just because I think it was during the same period,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I remember correctly, that Apple introduced these public test flight links.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe it was actually the other thing before then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think it was the first time that I really tried the public test flight links.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:29.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just tweeted those and sent those to people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I didn't set a limit on how many could join</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until a bit later in the process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the first few days there were a limit while I was like smoothing out the rough edges.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't want a lot of people on it. But then throughout the beta, I just opened it up to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of people. So I ended up with a lot of people on my beta. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I definitely think that that's... I understand there's different reasons for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:59.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">different choices for people. But for me, having as big of a beta as I can get before a launch has</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has been really nice, if anything, for my peace of mind.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then also, like you said, it's sort of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, it builds a little bit of an audience,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and if some of those people tweet about it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or talk to people they know about it or whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that can help make that launch a little bit more of a thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I also definitely recommend that you have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as big a beta as you can get, basically,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because as you mentioned, it is really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's great for your own peace of mind that once you hit the App Store,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all the rough edges have been smoothed out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I also think it's a pretty good strategy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to launch and soft launch an app these days</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because as an app developer, at least I found that for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think for most others as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it is quite difficult to get some coverage for your app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you're just launching it all of a sudden.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There aren't that many media writing about apps anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There are some, and they're doing us all,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all the developers, a huge favor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's so kind.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But actually having a test flight and a big test flight</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and growing an audience before a launch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is a way to get some people speaking about your app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the day that you launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, another thing I've done too is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on launch day, I'll push a test flight update</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's specific to test flight that pops up a banner</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's basically like, "Hey, I'm not taking it away</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right now, but like this thing came out would be great if you shared this with people and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, it had links or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how effective that really is, but it's another sort of marketing channel,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least potentially.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's a great idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I never thought of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's a super good tip.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was runestone the app, but runestone the library itself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did that launch go?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Has it found somewhat of an audience?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Are there people like using it that you know about already?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:59.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it's the first time that I launched an open source framework that I really feel</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I've put some effort into at least.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:07.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I have other small open source frameworks, but this one I feel like that was properly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">documented and I had a nice readme.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a quite complex project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's a big thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that really felt like launching something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I've open sourced a project, it didn't really feel like launching anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like putting something out in the void.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was actually a launch, but I had nothing to compare it against.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've never done it before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But people were really...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some people were more interested in the project than I had thought.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I think I once again, I thought that I would launch this out into the void.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then maybe in a year or two, some people will find it and think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, this is the framework that I need," you know, randomly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:54.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it turned out that that need that I thought would be there at some point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was maybe a bit bigger than I thought.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:02.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So already from before I open sourced my project,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had people write to me that they were intending to integrate it into their app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, wow. - And they were eager to try it out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Was that a little scary too? Like, obviously exciting, but...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- A little bit of pressure? - That's a lot of pressure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was like super intimidating because all of a sudden,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All of a sudden, I knew that there would be people looking at my code.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah. I didn't even think about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know if they're actually looking at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can't know if they're looking at it, but at least they have the opportunity to look at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If they want to. And that's super intimidating.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That put a lot of additional stress on the development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:43.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was writing a small hack or doing something that I knew was a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an ugly workaround or so, I always felt like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how am I gonna communicate this to people?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how am I gonna put this in the documentation?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Am I-- - Yeah, that's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I felt like that was a bit more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was, yeah, I felt like it was a bit more intimidating.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it was, at the same time, it was super nice</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to know that there would be people who were interested.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, for sure. - That it wasn't just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something that I believed, but that I had tangible proof,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just in form, just as you know, messages and so on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that people were interested in to some degree.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I actually did a small beta of the open source framework as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I contacted some of these people that had told me that they wanted to integrate it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just had them play around with it for, I think, a week or two before I open sourced it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, just to smooth out the edges</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and give myself a chance to receive some of the questions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that people would just have on day one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have those answered if I could.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you're prepared with a smaller group size.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, then when I open sourced it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it turned out like, I think just a few weeks later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the first apps were out that were using it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">besides my own.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, that's cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So that was super cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then after a few months,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of the mobile team from GitHub wrote me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that they were integrating it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Whoa! - So that's also super cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it has been quite good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for the open source framework.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, seriously, that's like the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's kind of the ultimate, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, how many people are viewing code in,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or editing code in the GitHub app?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, that's gotta be one of the bigger iOS apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in existence for people doing that thing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, probably.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I don't know the user base,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I do remember like a year ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I was talking with some of my friends,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're like, "Why are you open sourcing this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What do you imagine?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I said, "Nothing."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I mean, it would be cool if someone like GitHub</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would use it one day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I remember myself saying that sentence</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and not really believing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then to this day, it turns out that they are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's so cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:11.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sweet. Well, I mean, it's been fun watching you do this. And actually, I don't know if</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you want to talk about it at all, but I feel like you're in the midst of essentially one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:22.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of these stories again right now. You are yet again building something that seems kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:29.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of crazy. It doesn't even have a name yet, right? This is your like JavaScript to Swift</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">UI project that you're building?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, that is the name right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, of course, one day I might...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's no secret, if this project goes well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it would be natural to integrate it into Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That would make sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess that's the long-term goal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But right now, it is like an exploration of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what else can I do in the space of JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JavaScript bridged to Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was like the idea of Scriptable, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">JavaScript bridged to Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or actually, the other way around, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Swift frameworks and APIs bridged to JavaScript.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right. - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tying a little into what we briefly touched upon earlier,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Shortcuts doesn't really have this sense of building UIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I thought it would be fun to, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">investigate and research if it's possible to bridge SwiftUI to JavaScript</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through JavaScript Core.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's a project that I've been...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that actually, I think, again, it started like a year ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then it's been like just sitting on a shelf as I wrapped up RuneStone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then now that RuneStone is like out and lives and has its own life,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've picked up this project again and made some progress.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just gonna say if any like if these stories of of Simon talking about building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these things and talking about it online if that sounds interesting to you you have a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">chance to watch him do it right now like it has been really fun watching you on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:19.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and often just being like oh my gosh this guy's very brave you are you are like definitely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:25.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">becoming the master of JavaScript and the intersection of JavaScript and Swift but it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's so much fun watching you in these phases where you're clearly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very excited about something technical and you don't quite know exactly where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's all going to land yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're just discovering and being very,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very open and talking about it constantly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was really fun watching you do that with runestone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's been fun watching you do that in, I didn't see the beginning of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but with scriptable, there's been lots of phases of it that have been fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I kind of feel like I'm watching it again with this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this project right now, which who knows if it'll go anywhere,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's a fun journey to watch either way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, sure. I'm super glad to hear that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really enjoy building things in the open, as they say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's just a fun way to build software</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because you get a lot of inputs,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:13.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and especially with this project of bridging SwiftUI to JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">two parts that I know very little about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't have much experience with SwiftUI,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:24.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I certainly don't have much experience writing production-ready JavaScript.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:30.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's just fun to put it out there and hear, get some feedback from both sides.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:38.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've gotten some really, really valuable feedback from both sides that has shaped the project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or the project and the APIs that I'm working with these days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's true for this JavaScript to SwiftUI project, or again, the other way around, really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on how you look at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's true for that project, and it was also true for Scriptable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Back then, I had zero knowledge of JavaScript,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other than just fiddling around with my own CLIs written in Node.js.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:11.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I didn't really know what would work in the JavaScript world in terms of APIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if people can, I definitely recommend building things in the open.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also understand that some people want to keep their projects a secret, but...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's never really been my thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Before we wrap up, I do want to ask you the question</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I ask everybody at the end of the show, which is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what's a person or people out there that have inspired you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and your work that you'd recommend others check out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, this was a super hard one to prepare for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I don't really, I don't feel like I can point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at one person or any person really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's not to say that no one is inspiring me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's right to say that there are lots of people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not like I don't really have one person</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I feel like this person is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's who I want to be, they inspire me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's more like something that they do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like, if you asked me this question 10 years ago,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would say that anyone who lives off...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who can make a living of making iOS apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they inspire me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you asked me 20 years ago, or 15 years ago,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would say anyone who makes a living of making software, they inspire me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's always something people do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I can dive into these...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and have these periods of time throughout a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where there is one specific person who inspires me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:45.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, that's because of something really specific that they've done.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I remember earlier this year it was a person named Marc Sieman</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who's been very vocal around design patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and challenging some of the design patterns presented by Martin Fowler.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I had a month where I just dived deep into the work of Marc Sieman.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And everyone who would hear me talk about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would just talk with them about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:12.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, do you know this guy named Marc Sieman? He does this and that."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's again for some very particular things that he made that I really believed in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I still have it to this day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, you're an inspiration to me for doing this podcast and like Christian Sielig for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:35.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing these funny things in his apps, like this PixelPale thing, making that work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, that really inspires me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's something that I hope to do with my apps one day as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:49.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, can I make a serious app somehow and then making this fun twist on top of it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is also technically challenging and impressive from a technical perspective,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though it's this goofy, delightful thing embedded in an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah, sure. It's definitely not easy to do what Christian did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, so it's difficult to point at particular persons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:16.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess I did that anyways, but it's like, I feel like every day it's a new person because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then I tweet something where I'm like, "Oh, this is super cool. I want to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to do what they have done."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. It's almost like the answer is the community, in a sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It feels weird on this day. Today is November 15th. So at this point, at least, Twitter is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">still alive. And so Twitter, you know, that, that sort of world of, of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are openly talking about the things that they build. This is something I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">found in the iOS community in particular, really inspiring is like a lot of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people talking about what they're working on. Like I've, cause I came from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the web world and lots of people talk openly about technical things they're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:01.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">working on, but like the product side and all of the different pieces all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">coming together and people being really open about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:10.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The iOS community in general, for whatever reason, has this sort of general vibe of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people just being really open and talking a lot about what they're doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I, yeah, I've, I find the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I ha I could have a list.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:24.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I could have a list 50 people long, uh, as this podcast maybe shows of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who've like been big inspirations for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:32.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like you said, it's like, there are times when I'm really into a particular</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">person, um, like recently, uh, Daniel Gauthier with, uh, with up ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I just want everything about that to be things that I'm doing, but I've had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lots of people, you know, my career or throughout my iOS time that have been</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like that, and you can probably see pieces of all that in my app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like a tapestry of these different people I've been obsessed with over time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">up ahead, that's really a great app. Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to time to talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:08.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things like Twitter and so on and the iOS community, because as you mentioned, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter is still alive. I don't know about you, I haven't checked it within the last</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one and a half hour while we've been chatting, but...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right, it might not be there when we shut down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly. But yeah, I think you have a good point. It's a good way of phrasing it, the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:34.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one you just had, of saying that the iOS community is their inspiration here. Because that is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:40.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a community that I don't believe you find something... You might find something like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:46.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it, but you don't find something exactly like that for many other platforms. I have some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have some friends who build apps for Android.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:56.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I have friends who build apps for Android, and they're looking at the iOS community saying</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that there is something special here that they feel like they're missing out on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Of course, they're also going to conferences and meeting people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think we have the benefit when we meet in real life, we've usually talked before</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It feels like people already know each other somehow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think you have that feeling in many other communities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that is because we share a lot of our work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:26.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's just like, it's a difficult thing to talk about because like, for all we know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a week, we might not have this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe it's on another platform.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, the good news is the people, the people are there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:42.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That I, you know, I wasn't part of the Apple development community until more recently.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:52.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I've talked to a lot of people who have been and a lot of people talk about like panic and the sort of delicious app generation as a similar kind of feel.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They didn't have Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:01.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think I hope that the community exists if if for whatever reason, Twitter isn't where they live.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:10.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really hope that they still can find a place to continue that sort of tradition of sharing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:15.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and being quirky and making fun, delightful things for the sake of making fun, delightful things and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">inspiring each other in some way. So yeah, we'll see where it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:25.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, there was a time before Twitter and of course, there'll be a time after Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but let's see. I mean, maybe Twitter will still be a thing. I hope. I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've tweeted that before and I'll mention it again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll be the last person to leave, not because I endorse all the things that are going on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but just because it's where people are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's where I get a lot of my news, at least my tech news.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's just the place to be, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yep, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:57.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm definitely scrambling around and trying to build any social graphs I can</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in other places, just in case.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:05.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, uh, for now, anyway, I really hope that it stays as Twitter and things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">stabilize in whatever form that that needs to take.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That isn't horrible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:14.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, that isn't hopefully like a bad thing, but you know, we'll see how it goes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We'll see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:21.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't want to end on a, on a sad note though, uh, because Twitter, as long as</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's still here, you're going to be tweeting about the, the crazy projects,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">uh, bringing JavaScript and Swift together.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so definitely check that out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:35.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And where should people go to find that and any other projects that you're working on?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think the best place to find me is on Twitter right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I'm @simonbs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can also find me on simonbs.dev,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:52.000</p>
