<p class="time-stamp">00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Moth. I'm Charlie Chapman, and this is the annual Christmas special</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the one and only Jordan Morgan.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">[Music]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Welcome back.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yay!</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">[Laughs]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, it's that time of year. It is. It is. Yeah, Christmas launched. You made a joke last time about this being an annual Christmas special and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Apparently took that the heart because I just assumed we were doing it this year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was really listening to that episode a little bit ago and I was like, oh, I guess I wasn't aware that this was definitely going to be a thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We do every year, but no absolutely definitely gonna be a thing we do every year. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Before recorded that I did pitch one hour of Christmas carols. I can tell it was just just you and I but I guess</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess we'll do a hard pivot on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, hard pivot to our deep thoughts on, you know, being app developers stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so, you know, if you're here for a normal interview episode, this is, this is not going to be that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We're just, we're just coasting up by the fire over here. I got somewhere, my dog,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">coppers curled up at my feet somewhere. We're just, we're just going to kind of sit back and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and relax and reflect on our lives in the last year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and where it's brought us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Fire side chess with Charlie Chapman.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sure next podcast right there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess to kick things off,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's sort of do some follow-up from our last year's episode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So last year, kind of the big thing we talked about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was you launching the best in class I/O/S app book series.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Mail it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, definitely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so you had launched it by that point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you were starting your trend of weekly updates,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or biweekly updates, which we talked about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">biweekly is confusing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And since then, I have seen a regular cadence</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of updates going through,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm not exactly sure from the business side</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of things how that's going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm just curious for a check-in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on how the book's going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's going good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is funny because a year later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">almost nothing has changed in that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm still just working a lot on the book.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it's the sales.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that was the big thing I was looking at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because you know, like one year later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they are not as high as they were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">during the launch year, but it still averages.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was looking to my little spreadsheet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I do for, you know, track taxes and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Still makes between 2,500 to 4,000 a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So still going strong, you know, through that game.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's been a good little chunk of income, but yeah, it takes a massive amount of time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's still the same cadence every, I say biweekly, maybe just 14 days, I guess it makes more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since every 14 days, every other Thursday, whatever works, you know, for your mental model is the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">release that I shoot for. But in terms of changes, I was doing two chapters at least when I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing those updates and that about 20 and a half. So now I've gone to one chapter at least</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every two weeks, which is a lot more manageable, because this thing is going to take a while to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">finish. And I'm at the point where everybody that's bought it knows that and they're fine with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it. There's been no complaints at all in terms of like, Hey, can you can you go quicker?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's in terms of pace, because you you already have laid out all the different books or the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">different, you know, sections of this. So do you have, do you have a sense at this point based on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your current pace, like how long it's going to take to finish? I think it's going to go into 2024.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or that's something I was gonna look at real soon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You need a burn down chart?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I need a nap chart.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Point to use or stories.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All my favorite things, jokes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To go on a tangent, like the same time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when we had this chat last year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like the start of my time off that I take every year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I have like three weeks off, I always wait for it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I like reassess where so many things are at,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like Indie-wise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was one of the things I was gonna do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like kind of say if I did a chapter every two weeks,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where would that put me when, when would the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the first version be done?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm pretty sure it'll be 2024.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I've kind of made peace with that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but another part of me kind of wants to take my sabbatical</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at work, which I've been up for for like over a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just like go ham on it and just crack out a ton of it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because, you know, it's gonna be wild to have it done</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's taking so much longer than I thought,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I realized that pretty, pretty early on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm at the phase where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know it's gonna take a long time and that's fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think last year when we talked,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was kind of like setting in on that realization</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, oh no, this is gonna take years to finish.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I've kind of just faced it up and see where it's at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But long story short, yeah, I think 2024,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sometimes when the table of contents</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as I originally laid it out will be finished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Just a little bit for anybody who didn't already listen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you've already made it this far.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The idea here is you release this book as a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the word use was beta, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's what I use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And basically, like, it was a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you had the first couple chapters or something done.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Nine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 'Cause what I started with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And then you've been, like we've talked about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every two weeks or 14 days,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you've been adding to it and kind of updating it as you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so people can buy into it now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and they get those updates.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But something I'm curious about is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">once you're done, is the idea that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you'll do like a big splashy like, and now the book is for Realsies out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you're done done, like you kind of, you know, now it's a physical thing that you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of put on the digital version of a physical shelf and you're not messing with it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are you planning on kind of keeping something going after that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so it's funny, today it's your first question like when it's finished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In my head like of course I want to do some, yeah it's finished, but I've worked so much on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At this point, I could almost just see myself just putting up one tweet like in a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right-of-afternoon and just be like, "Alright, I finished it."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, it's over.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You look up for your computer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You never booted up again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Walk off.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Move on to the farm.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I mean, no, I mean, there are plans I want to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The original plan and still what I have in mind is when it is done that first version,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do want to split it out, book by book so I can offer those for sale.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like if you just want accessibility</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or maybe you're more interested in design,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you could buy those at a cheaper price point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than the whole series.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then of course, from a business standpoint,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it's much easier to sell the total package</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you have individuals some stuff or two.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, it's like, well, I could spend X amount</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of dollars on two of these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or I could just bump it up a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and get all five.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it'll help from a business standpoint</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but also give people more choice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But no, I mean, I kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I envision this as an evergreen project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to work on for years and years to come</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because if I'm looking at my document right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've already got like 20 or 30 things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I wanna add after I'm done with the first version</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because of updates to previous chapters.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, at that point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I, so I really started this when iOS 14 was out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I have a bunch of notes for iOS 15,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've got a bunch of notes for iOS 16,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and by the time it is done,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll have notes for iOS 17 for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like, I am gonna come back and write over things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like Swift charts, for example, that's something I wanna do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or just small things, 'cause every year iOS gets a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">better and better and there's these little tiny improvements</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they make and I don't wanna miss any of those.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've got a lot of notes on just like quality of life</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">improvements to go over.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the good thing about that though is while I'm writing it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like this, it's not like I'm missing all the iOS 16 stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or iOS 15, like the last chapter I just did</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had a lot of iOS 16 stuff in there because it's out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and in the wild.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, so I do wanna split it out, book by book,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I will keep working on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I do know that once this first version is done</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm not in the gauntlet of writing all the time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the prospect of adding some chapters every few months</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is much more like, it doesn't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the thought of that doesn't stress me out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or I don't have the thought of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll be sick of it and don't wanna do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 'Cause writing is already a part of your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of life anyway with the blog.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just love writing too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it'll be fun,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'll have a lot more balance in terms of my indie life</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at that point. - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Because it's all writing, writing, writing, writing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very few time for development,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is, we chatted all the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've started like six, five, six apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and finished them like 50 to 80% of the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I have to get back on the book</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm all over the place with that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it'll be nice,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it'll always be worked on as far as I can see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's, I didn't think about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the fact that older chapters are older versions of iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I guess as part of the sort of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is a complete package,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you don't also need to get those updated</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to a more current version.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you were gonna try and say like the book is done</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as a sales pitch kind of thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was gonna ask, do you envision a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a physical version of this book at some point?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But based on your answer, it almost sounds like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be kind of difficult to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since you're wanting to always update it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It would be, but I want to so bad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was actually just looking at this yesterday,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wide shot chatting with another buddy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could see as if I could figure out some way to say,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is version like the 2022 version, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can buy the brand name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can still get the digital,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so you could be up to date going forward.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there's like nothing beats</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like holding a paperback book, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Having it on your shelf that you act like you've actually read it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And it's massive at this point too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's gonna be thousands of pages.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's already, I think over the thousand mark for sure,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on like your font settings and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, it would be cool to have like five books</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and to be able to physically hold those.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the thing is like, that's a whole world</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I've had a few talks with like some smaller publishers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would be interested to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna make near as much money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on that than I would just direct sales.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's just the fun of having a book.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then there's some like print on demand things you can do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think Kindle Direct published clean KDP is what it's called.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then there's another one that Matt from NS hipster</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">did with flight school, but that involved</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like setting up an API with a bunch of web stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I didn't want to dip into or would probably screw up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it would be nice to be able to do it on demand.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think if I could figure out how to do it that way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">once the first series is done, I'll definitely do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that'd be cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It'd almost be like what are they called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When like video game company,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like indie game companies, they'll do like a fizz of the whole job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, like after the fact,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's more for people who already like the thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to A, support it more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and B, that kind of have it on their shelf</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as a fun, you know, physical object.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And then that way too, like once I do more updates,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I could see myself just re-uping the print copy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like in December.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, it's like, hey, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's been updated now for 2023.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if you wanna buy another print copy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the updates you can,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or you can just stick with the digital.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then there's other cool things too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I would love to have it on a website somehow,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I noticed Natalie did with Neil Cole</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">co-well-lessing, I'll about to really screw that up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Her UI kit book and SwiftUI,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you can log in and just kind of browse it online</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on their website, which is really nice too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, to kind of just like command F,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">find what you want,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or where you can do the other formats as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I kind of look at the book series</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:58.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something that'll be evergreen side income for as long as I'm right in software and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the iOS industry. And so far a year and a half in it has been that, but coincidentally</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">enough, on the day I'm on launch talking about the book series, I'm on my biggest sales</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">droughts. It's really, we'll see, we'll hope for the best here. But I think it'll be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">good to have, you know, as people come and go to the industry and, you know, stumble upon</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the work, I think they'll be interested in it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:27.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that was like, it was good to hear that you were still making sales throughout</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this because one of the things I always wondered was, you know, like writing the cliche</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with writing is that it's, you know, this really difficult task with in terms of motivation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we had talked about this last time with you having the pressure of people who've</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">already bought it and people continuing to buy it to kind of help you motivate you in terms</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of continuing to write it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:54.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's easy to imagine at some point, it sounds like maybe you're kind of in that, at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">least in a short term right now, not having these sort of regular sales.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like that motivation would be a lot harder to drive yourself to keep, kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keep plugging away at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Although it's you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you're sort of driven by lists and processes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I feel like the fact that you have this cadence probably helps you get through that easier</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than most people writing a book.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've got my, I almost said notion, craft, not notion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My craft document opened that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I can see like all the green check marks I have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I finish a chapter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like, there's that motivation of like seeing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when things are gonna, you know, be done and finish up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm really close to finishing the third book</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over user experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've got like three chapters in an epilogue.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then after that, really, it's like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the biggest media is one over iOS frameworks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then after that one, the fifth book is really just kind of like a bonus add-on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's got like five or six chapters over just like catch all tips.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't know where to put anywhere else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think mentally when I get to that last one, it'll already feel like such a weight off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my shoulders anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And not that I don't enjoy doing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I learned stuff all the time, but it is like another job for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, this is something that I have to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it eats into your other side projects, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the biggest lesson I've learned by far</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this whole thing is just opportunity cost</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">more than anything else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like I can't seem to really get that lesson</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">drilled into my head into a good way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because there's been parts of my indie journey where I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all I do is write software now with Spence Deck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't have any time to write on my blog.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now I'm like, now all I do is write on my blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and for the book, I don't have time to make software.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I envision myself being at a good place</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of take those lessons to heart</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when this first version is done</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and have like a healthier balance</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I have found I love doing all of those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">writing on my blog, writing this book,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">book series, see, that's why I'm so bad at marketing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sometimes like switch from calling it a book to book series</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to doing an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's kind of where I wanna get.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it is encouraging and easy to write</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you wake up and see that people have bought it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and have learned the lessons of any product that you sell</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that there's just curves.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I just had a Black Friday sale.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, I had a big bump in sales there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then you go a few days, it doesn't sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then you go another few days,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then all of a sudden, like three people buy it in one day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then five, and then zero for a few days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's just how these things go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you get used to it after a while too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like those little loles don't bother me at all anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Are you still spending time and money in marketing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We talked about that a bunch last year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm curious where that's at at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The short answer is no, not as much as I did last year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So we had a lot of talk over like the Twitter ads I've tried.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Facebook, podcasts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I haven't done the Twitter ads for a while now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm sure maybe we'll have some fun time to get to Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But with all the baggage that kind of came with that, I just kind of got to the point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I'm like, I just don't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">People find me on Twitter for it, then cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is a shame in some ways, because it's the perfect place to market this kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:11.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing, but Twitter is just like in a weird spot. I tried a lot with Facebook as the last few</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">months. I know a lot of people that have had success on Facebook marketing, but I just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know. I'm not, I'm either not good at writing the copy or setting them up as a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">little bit complicated. Twitter's interface, I think is a lot easier. And it's really intimidating.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I don't know. I've got like some things kind of working there, I thought, but not enough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to our like, all right, I'm not going to invest more in this because I don't have the infrastructure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">really set up to attribute like sales directly from Facebook.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:44.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just made this identical page for the best in class website.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just have slash FB and point to that so I could like, at least see in my analytics like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who was coming from Facebook to that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I mean, you know how the Facebook app is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You open it in their browser, which I don't like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then you have to like hop over to Gumroad and download it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if you're coming from a mobile device, it kind of feels disjointed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, and the user overlaps probably different too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like we talked about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> It's for sure the iOS community kind of lives.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> And they're willing to pay money for things too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It seems like, you know, like, people like buying things from people they follow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I've bought some stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I just mentioned the book from Neil Cole,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the lesson blog that I enjoyed getting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So at this point, I'm less into like, all right, this thing just got out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let me really, you know, toy around with marketing and I have a lot of disposable income</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do with marketing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm working on this and it's like, good side</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it comes so if people find it, they find it if they don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Staying in line with the writing theme here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You also have a blog, we talked about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like there's been some back and forth on that also</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being a source of income.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know last time we talked a lot about this podcast and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sponsorships and that concept.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You talked about how you do it on your blog and I'm curious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what the whole story is there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm saying I'm curious as if we don't talk all the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but really, it's like, I just come in with words.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Let's bring everyone else along with where we're at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Let's do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We haven't just sat down and talked about this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and selfishly I'm very intrigued by this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's a great subject, 'cause again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is something I learned a lot on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, at the end of last year, when I was kind of looking at like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I ever wanna try being an indie, like what could I do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the three things I identified were,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the book series will always be around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I know that, I'm good with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So hopefully I can get income from that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I love writing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So how can I make money there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's where I came up with sponsorships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the third pillar, which will,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I hope, be the biggest one by far in a way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be my own software, which I haven't gotten to yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We'll talk so much about that after this, don't we?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Totally, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So, as well you shouldn't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I knew I could get to two out of three of those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in 2022, which I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what I found out is how insane it made things for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a little bit until I rejiggered them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for a while there, for like the first five or six months,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was writing a chapter in the book a week,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is already a mountain work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, you got to research it, you got to edit it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you got to make the photos, you got to do the email,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you got to, you know, send it out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do the updates on Gum Road.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's a whole thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was writing one post a week on the blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of justify selling sponsorship slots.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that just like torched me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I found where my limit was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like while I could do it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it wasn't like a healthy art, I'm doing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was like a holy crap.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm down on espresso,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">working in the morning,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">go to my day job,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do all the stuff with my family,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then spend an hour on it for granted.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Pressing it for granted.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and it was just way too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, whilst, I feel like I learned a lot of the lessons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that Johnson del did,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">only like a thousand times faster.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And not because I'm wiser,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but just because I realized what he did</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that it's a lot of work to do sponsorships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you look at people's blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a lot of the formats, they're all the same, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I just copied Daring Fireball,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like put something in the side, two sentences,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">link to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you're like, oh, that's gotta be like easy income, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like just throw a PNG up there, just do some copy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like what a great way to help out another company</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and help yourself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's more than it seems.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like anything else in this world, you know, you got to reach out, you got to go back</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and forth on copy. Hey, this image doesn't look right when it's like in portrait or landscape.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Can we try this one? You know, negotiating like prices a little bit. And so it just got</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the point where I was selling so many weekly slots that that just was like, I can't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do this. Yeah, it's a job. No, it's all right. Yeah. And again, you're promising an article</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a week too, which is more working of itself. And so if we want to skip ahead, what</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What happened was I did the sponsorships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The good news was they were easy to sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I even raised the price like two or three times because I was like, well, I'm selling these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too easy until I finally got to the point where someone was like, yeah, that's a little</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">high for the traffic.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so which I'm glad I hit that point because I knew I wasn't like, you know, underselling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then then I hit that inflection point where I'm like, okay, this is too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just ripped the sponsorships out all together.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just the page is still up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just didn't put the link like on my website.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you go to it now, it's just like, hey, these are on hold if you found this link.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What happened was towards the end of the year, I still had people reaching out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Me not doing any outbound, just two or three times.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They're like, hey, can I still sponsor it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, I'm not doing it right now, but I'll get back to you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I found this really happy medium where if I just sold a month slot all at once, then all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of a sudden it was really doable because the work came from having to promise an article</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a week, having to like switch out the sponsor that was actually on the website and getting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the, you know, the copy down and all those things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where if like, if you just do that once a month, then if you're going from four times a week</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to one, like you're cutting down the work by 75% and why you're not making this much money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as you would for weekly, it's still like, you know, worth your time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you only have one like sponsored tweet to do and that really hit home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm in that mode right now and I'm still not really actively advertising them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just putting them up from people that have already sponsored that want those slots.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So once a month has been like a revelation for me, I can definitely manage once a month,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's where it's at right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that I think we talked about this last time, but that's always been the struggle for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this show is like, I have people reaching out to do sponsorship. So I know it's a thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I could do, and a lot of people would be like, "Oh, why don't you just like take the money?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, why would you not? And I'm like, because if it's a job, like, there's, there's sort of infrastructure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you have to set up there. You're managing relationships and expectations and there's just a level of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pressure there. I guess pressure, I don't know. Like, I don't have, I feel like I'm pretty consistent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this show in terms of there's breaks, but there breaks that I advertise ahead of time, plan ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of time. It's not like, it's not like that has really been an issue surprisingly in terms of keeping</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">up the right cadence. But I was at that, like, I've always been at that level of, I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have extra room for another side project, which is kind of how I always viewed the sponsorship.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we talked last time a lot about how one of my reasons for wanting it is to try and get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an editor, because if I could pay for an editor, then I could spend more time on dark</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:46.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">noise or or managing sponsorships or whatever it is that we want to do. And over the summer,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of decided that the approach I wanted to take was try and pitch this show to networks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:57.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to try and like get it on some tech network because they have the infrastructure and sales</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people and all that stuff to try and manage, you know, sponsorships. So I thought that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:07.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would be good. But like I started building like pitch decks and as I looked at my numbers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm like, I just don't think this show,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll just say I'm right here actually,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like right now or at that time anyway.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Episodes were getting about 2000-ish on average,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like unique downloads at the like 14 day mark.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think for a just random side project thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, it's better than what I would,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah exactly, I don't have the best way of measuring.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Unlike, I feel like a lot of worlds I live in,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">everybody's really public about stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Podcasts are weirdly secretive about numbers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's so many units.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, you had a tweet yesterday</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that showed dark noises just taken over the world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, I mean, you just gotta share everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, and like the company I used to work for,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">plus you actually have sort of defined me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as a person who is very public with numbers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess Curtis Herbert kind of in the same boat,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but when I sort of jumped into this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we've talked about this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but right after Spence that came out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you wrote that blog post about your numbers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the company you work for is also like very hardcore</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about transparency sharing everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you took that same approach and I found it incredibly helpful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to just see numbers for something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I could at least gauge some sort of level</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of expectation around things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started kind of doing the same thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've been trying to do similar things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'll randomly tweet out numbers for dark noise</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and also for this podcast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But anyway, I didn't have a good measure,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the numbers that I was able to sort of get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through talking to some different people and whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think, I still don't think this podcast is quite</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at that level where it makes a whole lot of sense</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a major network anyway to want to take on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I kind of backed off of that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I tweeted out like I always do a bunch of these numbers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I had gotten in preparation for building this pitch deck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Jonathan Ruiz, who's a, uh, he had a podcast for a while and has been in this space.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He reached out and was like, Hey, I really liked editing this podcast that he used to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with a friend and I'd be in the robots one, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yep.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Everyday robots.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, which was great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, I don't know if you guessed it on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, I really liked that show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and that was, that was the big thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So he reached out and was like, Hey, I connected it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">guests and I'd be interested in helping you out. And I was a little chicken because I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the idea of putting work on somebody, you know, where I feel like I'm getting a little too</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">much of the, I'm getting the public attention for this. So I, right, we've talked about that I get a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lot from the show. I get to talk to people and all that stuff. But he kind of talked to me into</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least running an experiment with it. And then if we can get the show to a point of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it making money, then I can, you know, pay him and he's kind of learning skills and all of that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hopefully Jonathan's okay with me talking about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If not, he can cut this out because he's the one that we editing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's the spoiler alert.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, he has been editing this quote-unquote season of the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it has been just a total revelation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the amount of time I was spending editing the show in combination with scheduling and recording</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all the other things that go with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think I fully groked how much of my indie time was dedicated to this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because a lot of it was kind of grunt work. Maybe the book is a similar thing for you where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know exactly what you need to do, so it's a little less like the app work, everything you do is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">unique, right? Like everything you do is a unique challenge and so it all feels very different,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you know editing the podcast, you kind of know what you're doing, but it just takes so much</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just literal time and freeing that up has been huge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I do have some of that time now and I'm starting to basically have the exact same conversation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that me and you had last year around sponsorships for the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm kind of playing around that space and I know people are going to reach out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and say that they'd like to sponsor, which I appreciate. And I mean feel free to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I will probably answer the same way I've answered before, which is I am thinking about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm not quite there yet. But I, it's curious, listening to you talk about that was sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">validating because I was starting to feel a little silly, turning money down because of the amount of work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is work to take people's money as weird as that sounds.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it is. It is fun. It's fun work, but my here's my take and when we do our next Christmas</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Bash next year, hopefully the conversation will go like this. At one point, you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just screw it. I'm going to just try it and see what happens because I think that's the stage</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you're at like, you know, if you try it and it doesn't work, then it does it doesn't work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, or you may pivot a little bit like I did with the sponsorships on the website</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I kind of had those same, well, it would be better when X or Y and like in my case, I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, well, when I get more traffic to my website</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by writing consistently, then I'll sell scholarships,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not scholarships, sorry, not even scholarships,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sponsorships, but then I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know what, I'm just gonna try it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and see what happens.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And nobody balked at like traffic or prices,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're not that, like it just, it went right away.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think you can come up with a lot of reasons not to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but at this point, I think you just gotta,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think try it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, even if you set low expectations for yourself in terms of commitment, not like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, people buy them, but just say, I'm going to try it for two episodes or one month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just going to do that and see how it goes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because that way you don't put that mental like burden on you where you're like, okay,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is the show of sponsorships now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Instead, it's just like, I'm going to try this two times.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if I like it, maybe I'll keep it going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If I don't, then I won't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're absolutely, that is, I mean, you're, you're hitting me right in my soul here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:12.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's exactly it. It's like, I'm afraid to start something because it's like, all right,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">now this is a show with sponsors. This is an it needs to have all the things. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, no, you're right. That is it's funny. This conversation sounds very similar</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to my conversation with Jonathan Rees, the one who's editing the show where he's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're not stuck with this. We can just try for a couple of weeks. And if you don't think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It works or I don't think it works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We can stop and you go back to where you are and nothing's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">nothing's harmed and I'm like, oh, you're right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whoa, this is, I think I have this all good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:48.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just have this incredibly conservative slow approach.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where's the same in that area?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, well, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is why I like talking to you about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because you know, I can talk to one of our mutual friends,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Josh Holtz, who he'll just do it a launch to me yesterday.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, he just will do everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if they don't work, he's fine and he just moves on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, we are different brains.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm like, yeah, sure, that works for you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you're Josh, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can decide if you want to start a conference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then a couple weeks later, you have logos and a venue</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">half booked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, what do you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We just talk about how nuts that is for a second.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Starting a conference, this is the Christmas special.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We can go over what we want.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And we can't, that is insanity.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I was talking to my wife, Jaden's, and about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I'm using my stipend at work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about tickets for this conference here the day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just a heads up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And she's like, oh, cool, what is that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like, all right, so you're not gonna believe this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you know those guy I'm always talking to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, laughing about, he's sending me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">funny gifts all the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He just started a conference and just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was like, I'm just gonna do a conference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, oh, okay, yeah, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm doing a conference too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then he did it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I cannot believe the like, just thinking about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that blows my mind, the logistics,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">finding the venue, actually putting money down</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do those things, the websites, figuring out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how to sell tickets, how to manage all that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I cannot believe he did that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's incredible to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is not, I don't have that skill set.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would overthink that for four years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's the thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You need a person who's not like what we just described</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like us where you take everything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and try to push over. - Just wait for it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And overthink each thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause you're never gonna get any of that kind of stuff done.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And just so everybody's brought along here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We're talking about the conference he's starting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is called Deep Dish Swift, which I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like he texted in a group chat</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we're in as like a joke, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">uh oh, somebody mentioned to me the idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of starting a conference and one of us is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, it has to have a funny name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And he came up with that name on the spot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then all of a sudden he's sending us like artwork</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that he's commissioned and talking about venues.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's like whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was stressing me out seeing somebody else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But he's doing it very responsibly too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's got these huge charts with how many tickets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he needs to sell, which I think he's close</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the break even point already.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Don't let his ex-terior fool you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's Mr. Businessman in a way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He had a whole thing that he shared that was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to make X amount of sales and sponsorships</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to break, he knew all of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that sounds like the scariest thing in the world to me to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:35.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But we're talking about someone who goes all the way from making an app to remind you of what your age is to someone who can go all the way make it a whole conference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like it doesn't surprise me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's got, he's got that bone in his body to just go and do things, which I envy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to steal some of that from him.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'll put a link to the conference in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's called Deep Dish Swift.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's in Chicago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's in May of 2023.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">30 it to yeah, I think already I'm gonna be right. Maybe I was thinking May 1st. It's it's on that April may like border</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:06.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My plane tickets are around that, but I don't remember when the exact conference dates are April 30 it to this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">May 2nd. They're the actual dates and I've announced this on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I haven't set it on this podcast actually, but again another one of these Josh texting me like hey</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you want to do this and I'm like, oh, that sounds fun and then it's now. It's a thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We're doing a live episode of launched at this conference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I don't think we've announced who it is, but the person is booked and I'm very excited about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Tim Cook!</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just a small kid.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, not quite.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I'm doing a live on stage episode in front of real people episode of this year podcast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That has to be your first sponsorship.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's it right there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There, let me pull a Josh Holtz on you and just be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you gotta just get a sponsor for that one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What better way?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, well, yeah, I don't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Or is that a conflict of interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because he already has sponsors for it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I don't know how that works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I don't take Josh's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna sue you type of person though, so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's true, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- She knows.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Once he decides to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it might just happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, he doesn't joke around so if he does say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he's gonna sue you, you know, pass the street shows</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that yes, he is gonna sue you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He actually does things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, yeah, I mean, I'll end this little plug.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for real, if you have any interest in meeting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other iOS people, which I've talked about endlessly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the show, how desperate I am to meet other iOS people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And another thing about this conference that's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, really cool, I don't know if I've other conferences</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have done this, is I think the first day is like a half day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it is basically a track dedicated to indie development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So he's got some great indie developers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some of which actually maybe all of them</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have been on the show before a lot of them have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think Curtis Herbert's on there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Emmanuel, Kervicea, is Maylon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think they're there, both of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and then I can tell it in Kai.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Either way, there's kind of a track dedicated to Indies</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and at least so far in paying attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the Twitter sphere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It seems like there's gonna be a nice gathering</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of indie developers there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it has the potential to be really, really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually, I think it's, it already is really good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's gonna be awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's definitely going to be so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I love the focus on the Indy track.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Link will be in the show notes for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a big part of why I want to go to these things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just to meet with other, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Indies on top of, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">learning about being a better developer and all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, I like the business side too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's so easy to forget like how many people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are doing the Indy thing as like their actual soul income,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, like, you know, Russ with Happy Scale, of course,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Curtis has been doing great for a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could go on and on and like we joked about last time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was on the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anytime you make a list, you immediately regret it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're like, I knew I just forgot like 13 people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So of course I'm forgetting people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it would be so great to learn</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on like more about the business side of things too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, I know Emmanuel shares a lot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with a card pointers like, and in his email campaigns,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've always been super interested in that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just soaking up all that kind of knowledge,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having all those people in one place</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:20.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">going to be a lot of fun to pick up those those tips. Definitely. So yeah, so you'll link</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:27.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the show notes as you would say at the end of a link in the show notes. Find out more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I guess I guess to like wrap up that little conversation though, I think you've talked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to me into I should just try it in terms of adding sponsorships to to this show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Just try for like two. Yeah, just limit it. We'll see because I feel like the last one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and did with me being like, yeah, I'm definitely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gonna try this stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now we're talking about it later.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, we'll check in next year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to see where that actually goes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm gonna have Josh make a Twitter account</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that just tweets days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So Charlie said he would start sponsoring.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you know that he will too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He wants to hear this that we'll just get a text that's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and here it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I automated it with all the, yep,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he'll go in on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I guess whenever I said earlier,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you're interested in sponsorships,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe don't email me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe do email me and--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And yeah, I'll, I'll,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna make a commitment to try it this year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Not, not a, like, I'm gonna start it and now it's a thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but in a, like, I'll even maybe say in the read,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, this is an experiment, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let me know what you think, whatever, like--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I called my sponsorships a beta when I announced them too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, like, I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's a term anyone's ever used for sponsorships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's amazing how much that helps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do that with lots of things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still have features in Dark Noise that are in what I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">call Dark Labs, which is like a game group.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That were like features at launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I still don't feel great about the implementation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm afraid to take that later on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You sure, Chris.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Someone just wrote about it too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And one of the links in that group chat with live activities,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they mentioned specifically the lab section</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in Dark Noise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because that's where the mix audio thing is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:19.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay. Well, there you go. You heard it here first. We'll try it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You heard it here first. Charlie's doing sponsorships. Everybody hit him up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:28.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Flood that inbox. Another thing I want to talk about is like you mentioned,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you have this, you know, life balance of you like writing and you write like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developing and right now writing is kind of the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the thing that's been getting all the attention, but you have been building some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you've had a bunch of different apps that have gotten to different stages of completion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:49.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there's one that feels like, you know, you've been sort of toiling away in the background</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a long time, treating it like a true business.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm just going to say the name right here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:01.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's called, now I can see because I have web came on your face because you said, I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want to reveal the name yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can't wait to see what the edit is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think we should just say the name freely throughout this whole section.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we'll just beef it every single time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, because I am working on this project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as well, so you know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well now I'll see, now that's confusing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause now if you beat that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sorry, Jonathan.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, jokes that nobody else is gonna understand</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">besides the two of us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Those are the best.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You haven't revealed the name of this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you have talked about what it is, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'll just let you pitch it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I don't know exactly how you're messaging this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right now, publicly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is a project management,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I always switch between product and project,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so I don't really know which one is right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So there's every acronym and every company ever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So project management tool built specifically for Indies</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and even more specifically, one person teams.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So people like you, people like me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every developer out there that they do everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's who I'm building this for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the backstory is I built a kind of hack together</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I was working on SpinStack,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had a nice little menu bar app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't pretty, but it did some very basic things for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I really loved and enjoyed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then as time went on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of been sharing it here and there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just doing a little tweets and people would ask,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, what is that?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then sharing it in the group chat too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it kind of got to the point where I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"You know what, I think other people could use this."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm at that point where I need to learn the lessons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I learned from SpinStack and not fall into the perfectionist</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like this has to be the one, like this has to come out hyper polished with all the features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And instead just stick to the basics.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So what it would do is basically have an emphasis on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quickness and lightning speed entry,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I'm building it around all the things that I use it for and that I need</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and betting that a lot of other indies value those same things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:59.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So get things in there super quick and then be able to organize them by like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is a feature or this is a bug and then track releases.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the nifty little thing that I've done,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I don't know if a ton of people are going to love,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which that's a good theme.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not going to know anything until I launch it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is that it kind of like gathers together release notes for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then I can kind of copy and paste them and move them around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, the one liner is product management software for one person teams.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was on the receiving end of this at one point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think you've probably gotten this a lot where you sort of like tease this thing and you're sort of working on and it's like, yes, please.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:41.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I was just on another podcast where we were talking about how I used Trello right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:48.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was like, yeah, that's the thing that's always worked for me, but it doesn't feel nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">built exactly for what I want. I sort of am using a thing that's really intended for teams and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, bigger sort of thing, but I'm wanting to use it for this one specific use case. And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:05.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the idea of another indie making something for, I want to say just indies, but for, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:11.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the sort of smaller team or single person focused, nice experience kind of apps feels like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right in my wheelhouse. And so I know I'm really excited about this and lots of people have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">express that to you. But yeah, it is like, it's a big ask, right? This is a Mac app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:28.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I've never done a Mac app. So there's that thing of like, I want to make sure that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:35.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do the platform justice. And even though I've used a Mac since 2006, I think as my main driver,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know what like a good Mac app feels like, but I don't want to miss all those fun little API</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things that like someone who's been on the platform for a long time would be like, oh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:49.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They missed this like that's an obvious thing and not like they would say it in a rude way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like those are things that I want to to try and hit and of course</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's be honest in the Mac community. They would say it in a rude way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Probably like oh this doesn't even select you know like so one of them actually and I've given a really early</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Alpha-build to to you and a few other people but one of them that I had to build all custom was like the selection of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">multiple tickets. So like, if you had like 10 things and you held down, I forget off the top</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of my head without doing it, but like shift or command, whichever selects multiple things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in macOS, like I had to customize the logic to like select all of those individually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like if you did the first one, the third one, the fifth one, you know, those would</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all be highlighted. Or if you hold down shift and click from like one down to the very bottom,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:36.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it selects all of them. Right. So like I'm trying to get all of those like table stakes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things in there. But either due to my ignorance of SwiftUI on macOS or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it is ignorance and APIs in general. A lot of those things if you want to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">customize look don't come for free. Like for example, I'm not using a list on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:58.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">macOS because just I could not get it looking how I wanted. But the trade-off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there is you don't get the free reordering. The selection I think comes with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:08.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for free when you use a 4-H and a V-stack or a lazy V-stack, like you kind of have to do all those things yourself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:14.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm so big on aesthetics and looks and I have it looking how I want it to look that I couldn't sacrifice the other things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which means I'm having to build out a lot of stuff by myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But as long as I keep the focus on a lean MVP that does a few things well, I'll be good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then the doubt monster starts to creep in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, well, how do I give people a reason to use this over linear for just one person, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause linear is like blowing up the world right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Everybody loves linear and it's a great product.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't wanna say that sarcastically.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've used it and poked around to get like inspiration</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's nice, but at the end of the day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's still built for teams.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, I keep telling myself like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could give myself 1000 reasons not to do this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Same as you with sponsorships or anything else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just gotta go and crack on and do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the other part of the problem is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as you well know, and we can get into this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a little bit if you want, is I keep working</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on so many other things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like, oh, well, you know what?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This one's almost done and it's way easier to put out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than untitled project, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So maybe I should just start with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm in this frustrating phase of doing so many</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">different projects, but not releasing any of them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while also spending a ton of time on the book.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I try and take a breather and come up for air</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just be like, relax.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you've done so much this year when I stop to look at it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I should feel accomplished, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I launched sponsorship,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're out like 60 blog posts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like 1,000 pages, like I should be proud of myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the predominant feeling I have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like I didn't ship something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's like nine at me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So again, I just go on that mirror,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">go around like maybe I should just ship something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's smaller that I can get out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'd be proud to work on before this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because this is like my big one, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So around and around I go in my little head</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and send you and some other buddies,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">50% done projects and start the the dread process over and over.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. That that seems to be the theme is like this thing is so big.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:11.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's not like you can just cut it off and it'd be useful early that you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get to a point where you're like, I need to just have something out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you'll start on a small thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then you get a certain way through that small thing and you realize,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, this is taking away from moving forward on the big thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then, but you do keep coming back to this, which feels like a good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">signal that this is the thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And maybe those might feel unhealthy,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but maybe they're good for you because it just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gives your brain a break.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because ultimately, you're like five layers deep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on side projects at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you might need--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">part of it is for fun or needs to be in your head for fun</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until you get close enough that it's like has business</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">viability.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because right now, ultimately, it's a project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're doing to sharpen your skills,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to make it make the book writing more useful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by having a project that you're working on, yada, yada.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But once you get closer,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you do seem to be treating this one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even more than like spend stack</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or any of your other projects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as I want this to be a business with a capital B.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, I want to work on it for a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're absolutely right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's where you keep spinning</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yourself around crazy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, you know what, all businesses start somewhere?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I don't need to have a big splash.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You watch, although I wouldn't be upset at all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if that happened, it's more about, let's get it out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's get a good foundation and build up from that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's, I need to take my own advice</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause like I'm saying, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll allow, that's what I should do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm not doing that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you know, you're not at a good spot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where like you feel like the code that you already have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like legacy code in a way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's like before the first launch even.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly, 'cause I've built so much</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with SwiftUI this year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:50.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, at my day job,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">otherwise to where it's like, this is trash and I can make this a lot easier to manage.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm like fighting that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:04.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you know, it is something to where like I need to hype up less in my head because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in my head I'm thinking like, oh, people expect like the same polish has been stacked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:15.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you know, the same kind of quality, but like with a better formed product, which I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would love to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But at the same time it's like, you know what, just that's all in your own head probably.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:25.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just get it out there, some people like it, you know, some won't and, you know, grow and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">make it better.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's, that's kind of what I'm looking at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm curious like, I feel like one of the things you did to sort of start making this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:40.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feel more real was you announced it in part to just give yourself that public pressure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I know I harp on this a lot on this show, but in this case, it feels like a really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">good use case.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:52.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It almost seems like if you could get a beta that people could use, even if it's less</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:57.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">polished, which I know is hard for you to do, like test flight or whatever, that could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:04.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get the ball rolling on the things that, so like I think the things that people will request</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:10.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are going to be the things that are useful for people more than the polish that you're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably caring about now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:20.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that might help with reframing your perspective on, like right now, you're like, all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right, I need to add a filter somewhere and it's going to have this little drop down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then once you start building it, you're you, which means it needs to be like the nicest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">drop down and it feels fully native.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's also kind of custom in these couple ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you'll go like really deep onto that because there's no, there's nobody asking for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the next thing necessarily, but once you have, you know, people that are like, Hey, I just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want this button to exist. You might be faster to just get the button out there in a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">less nice looking way. And then polish on it, or maybe everybody's like, yeah, that's, that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">good enough. And you can move on to the next thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That, that's a great point. Because yeah, if I don't have someone over my shoulder, so</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:06.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to speak, asking me for other enhancements, I will spend two weeks on, on a dropout. Like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:14.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess one example of that. Yeah, exactly. Because like that's the only reason the book is working is I have the external pressure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean that in a positive light and I like oh pressure, but like I have to I have to do it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:23.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I've promised it where it's like another good example like if if you play around in the app now and like you made a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">An issue or ticket whatever you want to call it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:32.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When it's open you can tab around every single element in there come like it's a Mac app like I gotta have keyboard navigation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would be embarrassing not to right</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:41.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that was not easy to do because some of those so many of those controls are customized heavily to where you know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had to do certain things to make it all work right a custom modifier to just like even get an arbitrary key down on Mac OS</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So all these things whereas at the end of the day if I had a beta out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know if anyone would notice that and if they did you'd find out soon and then you could prioritize it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly because in my head I'm optimizing the app in so many ways for people like you know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:09.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That have been blogging about Max for 20 years because like I had this nightmare scenario in my head with like oh</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:15.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Look it's a swift UI app on Mac OS that looks nice, but doesn't even have keyboard navigation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you know that thought like terrifies me, but you know what it's kind of like screw it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it doesn't right now, but I can do it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know and I kind of need to get there because you know I'm looking at the email list like I announced it once and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's got for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:34.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">429 people that are signed up, at least someone interested. So it's like I could get a good beta pool, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The thing I need to fight with that and you're always telling me not to worry about it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:46.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's so hard not to is like I'm so scared of like someone copying stuff and I know that's so silly and I always tell people not to worry about that too</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like oh</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like if I have something if I this one in particular</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:59.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not the idea is not the gold here. It's gonna be the implementation, right? There's a million project management apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The thing that's going to make this work is the expertise and polish that you apply to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this and care and attention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And somebody that's just copying isn't going to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, they're going to copy linear.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They're not going to copy you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, if they do, I don't think, I don't know, maybe that's easy for me to say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's not me, but I really don't think that that's going to be a high risk.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, do you ever fight with that with Dark Noise?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I know you have a, like, where are the opposite there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I took my betas pretty close with SpinStack</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I like cut 'em dead as soon as like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the release came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whereas you, I always see you pushing out a beta,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">openly asking people to join it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and tangentially related, I see that a ton with streaks too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, he's always putting out open betas.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in my head I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, these are like paid up front apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like how can they afford to do that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But obviously it works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't know too much about your space to wear,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like if there's others in these tackling it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which sounds weird that I'm like kind of self-conscious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that other Indies would like try and copy it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it sounds silly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now that I'm saying it out loud,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because outside of that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the only people I'm really battling are the big boys</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who probably don't really care what I'm doing anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yep, and if there's other Indies, again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, I really don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">especially with this one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it would be so much work to copy it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And by the time they got to that point of doing that much work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're surely gonna have a different idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of how they're gonna work on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If they're willing to put them on a work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you put into it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're gonna put their own spin on it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like, I don't know, it doesn't feel,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it's a little different if it's one of these small apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's like a unique hook, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or something totally different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's maybe easy to implement,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's the idea is the gold.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the area, you have to hold that close to the chest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something, or the implementation is difficult.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you want to keep how you did it secret.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But in this case, it's just grinding out the work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and having the expertise on UX and understanding the gig</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is something that you're one of the foremost</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the experts on probably.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I try.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And especially in the Mac space,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:19.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how many people are making low effort Mac app clones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's probably a lot less than I was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, you see it on iOS every now and then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like my heart sinks when I see it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if I take a step back and I look at the times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that that has happened,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the apps that maybe ripped something off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are outright copied, like didn't do anything anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, and I know Christian Selleck had this problem</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with implosion a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause he did an entirely open source</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out of altruistic reasons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you want to say, hey, look, you can look at the code.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you don't have to worry about what I'm doing with Safari.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think was his original motivation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then he dealt with some apps coming out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that were super similar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you see that, but then at the end of the day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like years later, 'cause I think he released that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with iOS 15 or 14 or something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like does he care really now about that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm sure he learned some lessons,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I don't know if he would really change</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too much about what he did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I could be putting words in his mouth right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll have to text back to that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's a little different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Just because it's literally the same code.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you could imagine that actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:24.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having an impact on sales, but like if somebody were to make an app called, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">super indie project manager, you're well, I was saying like in the case of dark, like dark</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sounds or something like that. Okay, gotcha. And it's a purple icon that's similar to mine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, like there's, especially in my case, there's a bajillion white noise apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that that one's going to make that big of a difference to me. Any material</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">difference. It's a little different if they're using your exact name, right? Obviously,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's an issue, especially sometimes people throw stuff on the play store, like the Google</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">play store with your exact name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, well, that's a problem because they're literally trading on my name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:03.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that hurts your, not just hurts your reputation, but like is deceiving people maybe,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is not great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But in terms of the actual impact here, because like that's more of a moral ethical</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like then a real problem.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:17.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've always looked at the test flight thing more similarly to like Adobe with Photoshop.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:23.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of like the people who are going through the effort of getting this free version</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What percentage of them really are representing people who would have paid in the first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">place?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Probably not a huge one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then if you actually measure that out, like test flight has a limited number of beta</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">users you can even have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:44.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if I look at my metrics on how many people have the test flight beta and I say even 50% of those people if they would have bought it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sure, that's like oh, that's a nice chunk of money, but then that's it. That's just a chunk of money at that point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It doesn't represent this kind of ongoing loss of revenue</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what it gives me right now for dark noise is a safety net like I pushed stuff out like I just added</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">telemetry deck analytics to diagnose.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could push that out through my test flight</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I could see a couple hundred users</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">immediately flowing data through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and there's no crashes, there's no weird stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that gives me so much confidence</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I have like a safety net there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I didn't do something at least horrible, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so-- - Yeah, I just need to adopt</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that mindset more, especially with this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because this is an app where I could really see</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the feedback being really helpful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because the audience is so defined,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">way more than anything else that I've worked on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'm probably not gonna get like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey cool, thanks for letting me try it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe you try a different color for this label.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I envision the feedback being more like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey, my flow works like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Can I, can I do that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Am I thinking about this right way?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or like this is awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What would really like take it over the edge for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as X, Y, and Z?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I do need to think of this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I do need to think of this stack once you put it out there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right? - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Like how much spin stacks after release development</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was people with different workflows asking for small tweaks that made their life way better.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it wasn't even close to what I thought it was going to be in the first place, which</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was I've talked about that to death probably on my blog, but like that was a huge issue</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And especially now with like kind of angling this already is like, hey, this is like a subscription</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">product.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I wanted to be part of your flow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:27.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I got to make sure I'm mailing those flows for everyone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's felt so good and right for me that I just know that, well, no, new that world</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so well when I worked with SpinStack, like all the pain points that I felt with like hopping</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">around from GitHub to Trello to paper to manage all of these things, whereas this worked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so much better for me even in like its crummy hack together state.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel confident that'll help people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's one of these things too where when I look at like the vision of what I want</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do with my indie stuff, this is like another thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">foundation sort of like the book series like something that I want to have like it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:06.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doesn't have to blow the world apart it just needs to be part of revenue that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know kind of comes together with other stuff because like you know I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like to the book because we're talking about sharing numbers and I think your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since it's really it's just under 150,000 which is great for me like I hear</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'm super proud of it but you know when you're being realistic like that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not like I can just do this and it's done like this is like that's not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quit your job money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Especially if you have a family of five.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I know a lot of that was launch numbers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think like two thirds of that was launched for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I kind of look at like, I want to take like four or five tiny, tiny bets and see if</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can get another thing that makes like $150,000.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then maybe make it recurring and slowly just kind of build up with some quality products</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would sum up to get me to where I want to go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Your multiple legs, if you're stool, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Absolutely, yes, absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I need to build the freaking stool though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I only got one leg on it right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's not gonna work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And even if the next leg of the stool isn't perfect,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I want it, it's just, it's gotta be out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, sort of like you talking about sponsorships,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like that's always been me with software</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in our relationship.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I can come up with a thousand reasons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not to get something out the door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like, well, it's gotta be this or that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's gotta be pretty, and that's not a novel problem at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like we all, a lot of people struggle with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But ripping the band-aid off and actually doing it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is so tough for me to say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's why, I mean, we mentioned it with the word beta</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's, I really think getting it more out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through like a test flight beta or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it's a lot less embarrassing when you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey, this is really rough guys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think I even told you all, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's gonna crash and your data will be saved</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the next updates, I don't have like migration.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:55.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And why?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You don't have to open it up to the whole world at first,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, that kind of thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:02.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it lets that, who was I talking to you recently?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I think it was Simon with Roon Stone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think was the app, I don't remember which app it was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was asking how a launch went,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and he was like, well, it was almost like a soft launch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause he had been beta testing it for so long</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it was really just flipping a switch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He felt pretty confident</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because there were so many people already using it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think there's something to go with that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the actual shipping it in terms of making it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a product that you sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a lot less stress around it being having</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these big bugs or something if you've already</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gotten a big user base that's already pounding on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think the idea of a soft launch sounds so appealing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to me, 'cause we were talking about this with Daniel</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with up ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He was joking with us how the hardest part of that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that in my paraphrasing was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just getting that launch rate.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I got to make a website, I got to make a video,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got to make the screenshots,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got to make the press get,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got to reach out to press,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got to make the tweet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a thousand things to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And sometimes you want to do that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like with SpinStack, I love doing that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm almost to the point where I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would be fine with just saying,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here it is, I'm going to slowly build it up over time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Instead of doing the grand boom,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like here it goes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, and you can still do the grand boom</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at the point that goes on sale.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you're, you know, that big rush before a release</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you're trying to get all this stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all these fixes slammed in and get pressed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and get websites and get, you know, all these other things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if the app itself wasn't part of that rush</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's already ready?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you're totally focused on marketing and all that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think there's maybe, I don't know if this is a cynical take,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like another element to this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in particular with this app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is you're imagining this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being an important part of people's workflows.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so if you can get it to the point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where people are using it and recommending it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of building an audience as this free thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it becomes an important part of people's workflows.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Obviously, with a very clear upfront,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is eventually going to cost money guys.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Once you flip that switch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There is a huge audience built in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who can make the decision right then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is this important to me or not?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they already know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the thing I think about is Mime Stream.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Are you familiar with?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So it's an email app that basically feels exactly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like Apple Mail, but it's specifically built around</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Gmail APIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's incredible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's, I've never liked any email apps before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this is the one I like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's only on the Mac right now, but it's so good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to have the guy who's building it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">His name is Neil.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can't remember his last name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll put a link in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Only there was a podcast, which was suitable</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to have such people on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, seriously.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to have a mod, because I adore this app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I like the Apple Mail app, but it's always been a problem</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with Gmail in particular, especially at my word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:07.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So I've heard Google focused.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And it has the little widgets that show,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you get a calendar invite, they have the yes, no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:18.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not links that then open up a browser to let you accept or not accept or anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just an incredibly good app and it's still in beta and it's free and he's been</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">clear that once this is officially released it's going to cost money but he could charge</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a decent amount of money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe I shouldn't say this publicly but he could charge a lot of money and I would</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">still pay for it at this point because it's like I would be so sad to lose it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a major part of how I work and manage email and email is such an important thing for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I hate it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this thing makes it a little bit less bad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I think you could have a similar thing here where like, you know, I first people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lots of people download it because it's free and they're curious.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:06.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But some of those people it'll click with and they'll keep asking for updates and changes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and tweaks and you can keep on making it more and more solid.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then they're going to start recommending it to people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you get like a little following.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so when you flip the switch, you have a group of people who've already decided it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">worth it at a certain price point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then of course finding that price point is always a difficult thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I really think, I know I have it in a lot, but I really think if you can get it to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an MVP point where people could start using it and then get that out there, even if it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:42.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not as polished as what you want a Jordan Morgan TM app to really feel like. I think that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that would be really worth it for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. I like the idea of that kind of changing a little bit to do that through a prolonged</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:58.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">beta. So that way I can have the clear delineation of like, okay, I'm at V1 now. You can</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">use the beta if you want, but from here on out like now it will be the page. Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I could, yeah, 'cause really all I need is to validate that people do also work the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">way that I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's almost silly that I have it because the slow, tiny little drips of information</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:23.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've given about the app, I've always gotten like, "Yes, that's what I want to do."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, like even just the sidebar of categories of stuff, I've had people be like, "I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">think of things that way too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I think of X, Y, and Z. That's how I want to categorize things."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it's funny because these Christmas specials, which I have nothing to do with Christmas,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just Christmas time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It always ends up being our sort of therapeutic moment where we both kind of face up the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things that we wish we were doing maybe differently and hash them out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think the Christmas gift we can give to each other for 2023 is you buy the bullet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">try a few subscriptions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just clean this up to where it's not going to at least crash and can receive updates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then just start going to town and getting feedback on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I've got it, I think for me, what I really have to do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and again, it's so hard and I've said it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is I just have to riff off the band-aid</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of it not being as pretty or perfect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as I wanted to be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because that's, and I also put that pressure on myself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I think if I write this book series</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about how to make great apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I had this other app that was objectively good looking,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like then this one's gotta like meet those standards.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - But really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's the lesson that I learned with SpinStack.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like you have to think less that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and more as a business.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if you really wanna keep working on this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you really wanna get it to that point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then you've gotta make some concessions along the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And not bad ones, but the right ones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right. - To start the train going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I can always make it pretty or after the fact.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:49.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And one of those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which you've mentioned multiple times already,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like I think it's worth diving into a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is subscriptions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You've talked about this a bunch with the spin stack.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So SpinStack was a paid up front app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I came out with Dark Noise soon thereafter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was already planning on doing a paid up front app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, you're thinking around that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was very similar to mine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll let you start.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I do want to kind of get a little more therapy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into our thoughts on subscriptions really quick with that too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've completely won 80 on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I started SpinStack all those years ago,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">paid up front was at the time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of like my favorite way to buy apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is not anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">True, the hand over heart, I prefer subscriptions now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was easiest to do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I've not built a subscription app yet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so I can't really speak to how easier difficult that is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know, we got stuff like revenue cat</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that everyone really seems to enjoy their store kit too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I guess makes it a lot easier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">As I put in a blog post that I just published a few days ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with Spinsack now being sunset,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the biggest problem with it was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:01.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes, there were product issues, but to fix those product issues, I needed a lot of work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think I could have made it worth it to other people and myself if I had recurring</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">revenue with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think with subscriptions, you're kind of saying I'm serious about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted to keep going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to provide value to you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And not only that, but it just is what it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They make so much more money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know, like if you look at SpinStack, it was often on sale for three bucks. I look at a $3</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app in the App Store and today in 2022, I'm probably not going to buy it. I can't try it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have to look at reviews. I can look at the videos. But I don't bad an eye in spending</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on like 30 bucks on like up ahead subscription, right? And how much more is 30 bucks than</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">$3? And I do that with several apps. I pay for craft, Ulysses, all sorts of stuff. And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm happy to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think the market is more prepared for it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and more accepting of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, oh my God, I did not even know my daughter was home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And she just, it's a Christmas special.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You have to have your family.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I do, they were gone at the gym.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Dude, that freaked me out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:08.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just sitting here with you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over there with my son, bam.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Bailor.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh gosh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's coming down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's funny, actually just--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's just your kind of like sneak enough on you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I guess you didn't see it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's hilarious.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- She like tugged on my leg, you little singer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I guess my wife's back from the gym now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now that I've had my heart attack,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, where I was going with that is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you wanna build a sustainable business,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think subscriptions are the best way to do it now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the market is more accepting of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the tools are there to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think it helps you build a real business,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and not an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think it would be easier than paid up front.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Course paid up front still works for a lot of apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know, Dark Noise still sells,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's still working for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I will say here on December 9th, 2022,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I think you would make more money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with subscriptions than you would as it is now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and I think I've talked about on the show,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if not, I've definitely talked about on Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I am in the process right now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of switching over and really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least experimenting with that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the same vein, a similar conversation actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with somebody, maybe you, about this a little while ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where it was like, you're allowed to try this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and if it doesn't work, you can switch back</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to paid upfront.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Absolutely, the other way, but with this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like, okay, if it really backfires,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's not like I can't go back.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, like I feel like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the big things that really changed that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One is like trying to look at this more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:47.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a business for different reasons our environment being a little different in terms of the tech sector.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:55.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But also a couple different sort of intellectual thinking, I don't know what's the right word here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Ways of thinking about it is like Daniel Goatsier when he was describing how</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one of my paranoia with subscriptions is it kind of makes puts me on the hook for like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">repeated value in sense of the side thing. I don't know that I can do that. And that always</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like really stressed me out. The idea that I would feel like people are paying me regularly. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">need to make sure I'm putting out lots of updates and everything. And he said he thought about this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of inverted, which is if it's paid up front, people are like, they're expecting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:35.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a couple of years at least worth of repeated updates. Like that's the expectation. Whereas if it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscription, they can cancel it if they're not getting that. Like they get the value now. And then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If they're not getting it later, they shut it off.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that freed him up mentally in a way that was like inverse for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was like a like, whoa, you know, moment.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the other thing is like what you were saying, my attitude's changing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was definitely did not like subscriptions initially.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I would say I'm still actually more in the boat of people who, if there's a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">paid up for an option, I would prefer that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just don't like that sort of mental thing hanging over me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, there are examples where I've really, really liked that model.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One of them is flighty.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know if you've used flighty much since it's come out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know flying has been a little less accessible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I dive into it all the time because Ryan and his team just do such a great job</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the design of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's so good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you're here to first that that will be an Apple design award winner.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, soon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like surely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Really?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That was not gonna not win.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's so good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's so good. - It's not a good prediction.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It gets brought up often,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's not overhyped.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It really is that good of an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the thing with that app is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when it first came out, it was like this app's expensive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, it's really, really nice,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but for how many people is this really worth it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I kind of, I always played with it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the free version of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's such a nice app, it's a good example,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to look at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I, you know, I used the trial the first time I flew.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, Oh, wow, this is really nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what really like changed my thinking was when I realized,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's $6 a month, which isn't worth it for a year for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I don't fly that often.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then once my mental model changed and I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the next time I flew after I tried that trial, I was like, wait a minute,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can just subscribe for one month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I will have it for both of these flights.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It is a thousand percent worth adding $6 to my round trip flights for my whole family to have this way better app version.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:47.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so once I started thinking about it that way, I've used it for every flight have gone on sense because it's a no brainer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And sometimes, if you like time it right, you can get two flights into one month or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I probably ended up paying more than the yearly flight for one of my years because I did fly a bunch then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:06.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that mental framework really opened my eyes to how this can be better for people too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because dark noise in particular, it is an app that a lot of people use every night</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or every day when they work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a big portion of my user base.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:22.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there's another user base, which is probably a bigger group that is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I use it when I'm on vacation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm in a hotel room, I'm trying to get my kids away.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have a white noise machine, you know, an actual physical machine that we have at our house,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but of course I don't lug that to hotels or whatever. So I just load it up on an iPad,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's how I get the kids to fall asleep or whatever. Like I hear that a lot from people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I don't have the analytics to back it up because I literally just started measuring this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I've heard it enough that it makes me think that it's a significant portion of my user base.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for those people, having an actual monthly option that like, yeah, it's not worth it for me to have this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to pay an annual price for this, but a couple bucks for this month while we're on this trip,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">100% worth it. And I like the idea of opening up those opportunities for people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And those are the two like thought technologies that was the word I was looking for earlier. Those are the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:17.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">two thought technologies, ideas that have made me like really open up to this as me feeling better</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about it. Because I think I was just feeling guilty about the idea of adding subscriptions,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's a side project. It's not like I think it's unethical for people to do, but for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since this isn't my 100% full-time gig, I always felt a little guilty about it, but I don't have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:41.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">those same misgivings now. I'm on the journey of exploring that right now, similar time as you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">except I'm switching the existing app over to it. I agree with everything you said. I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscriptions honestly are just the best for everybody involved at the end of the day because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if people enjoy software and they want it to be developed, then we need to continually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:03.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">make money from those things that we're making to justify that or to kind of get you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over that threshold to where it becomes like your full-time gig.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the great thing is, as a consumer, is they can offer that up so many different ways,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, "Flighty, like, hey, I'm flying once a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have no need."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm sorry only once this whole year and one month I can just do the six bucks and get the value from it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:26.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Perfect. I mean that's not a subscription to them, but that's how it's packaged up right and then if you love it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then maybe you hop onto the yearly and that's the other thing every subscription I buy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was trying to pull it up on iTunes connect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how on the Mac App Store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Almost every subscription I buy I always do the annual like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's why it's so interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you mentioned flight, though,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I hadn't really thought of it that way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that's a great example,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I don't like the mental burden</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like adding something to like my budgeting spreadsheet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But like if I could just buy it in one shot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then decide a year later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like do I still want it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do that every time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it shows two different scenarios,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">buying it for a whole year versus buying it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for this one-off situation that I have for six bucks,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's what subscription gives to you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so as developers, if we can make more money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do these things we love and it is consumers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you've got options, how you wanna consume</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and pay for that, like it's no wonder</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that they're so popular now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's easy to say, oh, subscriptions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and other subscription, but not really all the time, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it's not like this handcuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you have to buy it for two months a year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keep paying for it, it's like you have the choice</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if it's not delivering the value that you want,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then you can drop off.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whereas if you bought it for one time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's not what you want, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you could either get the refund or the developer stops working on it like like spin stack because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you get the nice launch, you get a nice little tailwind, but then you've got to really dig in and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">become a business and you need to reaffirm the value you're giving with more revenue and recurring</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:00.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">revenue and it's just all all signs to me points towards subscriptions and I don't see myself ever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shipping an app that isn't subscription based at this point. I definitely think there's like I do still</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wish we had the ability to do paid updates.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That would be nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, but there's a lot of--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:18.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a lot that's cleaned up by not having that as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The fact that with a subscription,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like everybody has the same version of the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There is complication with, do they have the free version</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or the not free version?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Especially for me, since I'm converting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like you have to treat the people who bought the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">initially different than free people, obviously,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because you don't want anybody to ever lose anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so there's a little bit of complication,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's a lot less complicated than,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, especially if you do frequent updates,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's 18 versions of the app out there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you need to be supporting all of them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you need to send security updates or something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so that you don't break the old people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you don't want to give them the new features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because they need to pay for the upgrade.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there is a lot of complexity that comes with that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and reducing that complexity lets you focus more on actual features,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which the people who are regularly paying,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's where they're wanting to go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it's a complicated thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I do think there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think it's a clean, like all pros and no cons,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but especially given that I have been actively</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">working on this for over three years now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I've talked myself into trusting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I will keep working on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that was another thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with when I initially launched it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like, I don't wanna ask people for recurring,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">money from them if is this going to be something that I tail off of?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I've done a million side projects before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is this going to be like a lot of those were eventually a board of it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it seems like the answer is no, it is Apple keeps coming out with plenty of new</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things for me to integrate with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also I have a endless backlog of ideas, including some that will cost me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:58.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">money, like adding servers that I've prayed to do without recurring revenue.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if I had recurring revenue, I can invest in that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could build out a bigger library of sounds</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are hosted somewhere else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can download and so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, and that's the other thing too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A lot of the stuff that we make has a recurring cost to us,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which again with Ryan before a flight</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and he had weatherline,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like that's the lesson that he learned the hard way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which he talked about on launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, which I could believe I just finished that episode</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a few weeks ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What did he say he was paying like five or $6,000 out of pocket</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to just keep it going?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is crazy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But you know, props to him,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I would be like, sorry guys, you're out of luck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But he was able to switch that up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and make a business model that made more sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not a silver bullet, but it does seem</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it's the best option for me out of what we've got.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so what I'm thinking of these side projects too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also look at them in that lens.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, is this an app?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hey, then I want to do and provide value.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's all this problem.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:52.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All the normal stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, could it justify a subscription?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, if it doesn't, like I kind of kick it off now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause it's like, "Well, I'm just gonna repeat</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what happened with SpinStack, best case scenario."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I wanna, I don't know, man,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just really wanna put my stay-up on things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and really start building a proper business</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the stuff that I put out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and to build a proper business,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you have to continually make money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and I didn't get into it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just wanna throw it out there too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that another piece of anxiety I have about the switch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for me in particular,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">since this is an existing app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like, always anxiety you have of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is the fact that it's paid upfront,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the reason why dark noise is working, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that, I doubt it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There almost no data would point to this being the case,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but there's that fear I have in my heart of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I switch this over, is it like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, now you're like the other white noise apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the only reason people were buying this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was 'cause it was paid upfront.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And most of those people were buying it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then never used it and they were just giving you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">their money and then turning around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now they're not gonna do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like there's like this, like this sort of fear</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'm destroying the business by doing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that the way I like undid that is what I talked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about earlier is somebody pointing out to me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you can go back.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:11.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's you're not stuck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Mm hmm.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so that is really like where I'm at right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still have a fear that I'm gonna switch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and be the one person,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because almost everybody seems like it helps their business.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But maybe I'm the one example of where it destroys this whole thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got what we did with this Charlie again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:31.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if this appear, put the internet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Yeah, well, another way that I think about it too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:38.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is when we think of those examples of indies</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:43.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who truly have a business from their apps that that's their sole income.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think one of them is not a subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think every single one is a subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Peacock.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that one's still still a $10 paid up front.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It might be, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There's less, there's less.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The one-high use to be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Now they switched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, what's the meme from Batman?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You either live long enough to become,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like, I think I actually tweeted that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one time about subscriptions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you live long enough to become the subscription app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:12.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which makes sense, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if you live long enough,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you get to the point where you saturated the people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who buy your app and now everybody's just getting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">free updates at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:27.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And perhaps the biggest thing that I think about is like, they can try the app, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people could not try some insects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You had to buy it and then see if you liked it, which sounds crazy, does it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like in the way?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Regularly, at least one week often multiple that are people asking for a trial of the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, now that is technically something I could offer with a like an app purchase,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know what I mean?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you could do a one time in at purchase.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, like having just a trial where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here you have everything, this is the whole app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you get it for three days or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a thing that a lot of people want,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:02.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">especially with a white noise app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because what they're really asking for is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna hear all the sounds</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because what they're really doing is downloading</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a dozen of them and trying to find the one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that they like the most and then they'll stick with that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And right now with our noise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the only way to try it is to literally give me money,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which makes that a much harder sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, and it was that way with SpinStack too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I go back to the product problems that I had.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They would download it and they were completely differently</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:29.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then rightfully so, they wanted their money back.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think trials open your market up so significantly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause you've gotta have a lot of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">looking at dark noise that maybe just don't want to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">buy it the $10 bullet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if anything, your success is a paid up front app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would look at that as a data point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as even more motivation to be subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if you can get enough people to pay 10 bucks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without even being able to try it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think you're gonna get a lot more interested parties</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who would happily give you a free trial</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then decide if it's for them</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when there's no barrier to injury.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll say just from a pure,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it's nice for my ego perspective,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it'll be sad to leave the paid up front</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">health and fitness chart category.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:18.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's pretty it's a lot easier to chart on that one than anywhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Especially on the Mac app store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's usually me and streaks kind of dates and the top.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:27.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's pretty much never chart.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would assume when we go free paid up front, because you just get the titans of industry</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who have the marketing budgets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:40.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if we trade the nice chart number for more money and sustainable business, then I guess</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that that's a trade I'm sure me and you both would would make any day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know. I really value my big head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Same here. Yeah. I mean, it is a to talk about that for a minute.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's such like an indoor from boost though. Like it's open up the app store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you see it's like, oh, number 10 number one number 15.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:00.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're like, yeah. All right. I like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That definitely feels good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hey, Charlie from the future here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this next part of the conversation we are going to talk about Twitter and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and mass it on and kind of our feelings</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with all of the things that are going on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just wanna put a disclaimer out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that we recorded this a couple weeks ago</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a lot has happened since then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just keep that in mind.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Probably from the time that I'm recording this disclaimer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There will be a bunch of things that happened</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because we still have a couple days till this episode comes out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then who knows how many days till you listen to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this is a very fast moving topic.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a reason I don't normally talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">newsy type events on the show</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause we record ahead of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:42.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it can make us seem really out of date.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I thought this was a good conversation,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:44.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one to leave it in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just don't know that out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, back to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So we are technically over your time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:52.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you need to wrap up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or do you wanna get into the Twitter thing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How about we do a lightning round on Twitter?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause it's just too fun to talk about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The world around us, in particular,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the iOS world that it lived in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm so excited to hear the "Smondolog" by the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter as an entity where we all exist.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That has been a major part of both you and I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">getting traction in this industry</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and being able to sort of build a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">already rolling my eyes out myself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:22.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but build a brand, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm an ignorant guy who tweets about my failures</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and hopefully people will learn from me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you're a smart guy who blogs about Apple APIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:31.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Smart doing a lot of work in that phrase.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nope, not allowing you a counter that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter's been where that lives.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And right now, Twitter is in an interesting place.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And by the time this episode comes out in two weeks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or a week and a half or whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:46.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it'll probably be in another interesting place</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that who knows, we can't even predict what it'll be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:49.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm just curious, where are you at with that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is, we're sitting here by the fire,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just enjoying some egg nog and talking about our thoughts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I know both of our thoughts are in this place,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably like a lot of people listening right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just curious what you think about it all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:08.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have gotten to the place where,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all right, let me back up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The beginning of the year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could not imagine life without Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let me say that to get the proper time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:16.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Which sounds sad, but let's all be honest with ourselves.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the example I've always given other people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like my family, for example,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he's not on Twitter, like my mom or dad,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like if something happened with my job</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I got laid off, the first place I would go to is Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I would find my next job through Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's such a valuable career tool for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and for the iOS development community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so all that said, fast forward to today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, I've just made peace that maybe it won't exist</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a year or so, which is just wild.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would never imagine me saying that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:49.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I have this odd sense of calmingness too about it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where it's like, "Eh, all right, maybe if that happened</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I've had these thoughts before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, am I still gonna be tweeting when I'm like 60?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, like am I still gonna wanna have this drive</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to like share everything I'm doing, which sounds silly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to say, but it's like stuff I've really thought about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm at this place where I hope it survives,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm not gonna try to help it survive</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and if the ship goes down,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll be the dude from Titanic playing the violin</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as the ship goes down and do my salute</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then just probably chat with people like you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:25.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and group chats and make reels with my kids on Instagram.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't know that I'll really go to Massed On</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or try to keep up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like whatever happens happens.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's so weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did not think I'd be at that place at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:39.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought I'd fight tooth and nail for it to survive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I love the iOS community and I have my blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:42.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and people did that before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So my kind of thought is just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, I guess if that used to work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though technology in the world has changed,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe it'll work again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or maybe Twitter survives and nothing happens at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:54.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But who knows on that one?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:58.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, I've said this to a lot of people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, so to back up a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I'm in a similar boat.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:07.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One difference is I'm a little newer to this world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:09.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Although I don't think I can really claim that anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've been saying it forever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In the last couple months, I think I've fully accepted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:17.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, no, I'm not building a network the way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:21.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I started this podcast,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:25.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was only a couple months into dark noise being released.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was only basically exactly a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into developing anything for iOS at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I had this, like, especially when the pandemic</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was starting to get close and it was looking like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">WWDC might not happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was starting to get pretty panicky about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how do I establish myself here in this world</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I really want to have that network?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:51.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In this podcast, it was a major part of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The biggest part of it was Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it wasn't the platform, it was the people, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's where the group lived.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:16.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's what I spent a lot of energy trying to create relationships with people that I felt like could make sense to help me out in this industry.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If I lose my job, I can help get another job in this space.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:29.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or if I want to launch a project, there's a group of people who will support me in the building it and then a group of people who pay attention to what I'm doing and would be interested or at least look at it or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I don't think I fully, I don't think I ever got off of that mindset.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">With the pandemic, I kept, I was like building in my head to, alright, I just need to sustain</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:48.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this energy of people paying attention to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That sounds weird, but I guess that's what I'm really, you know, and I look in myself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's what I'm thinking.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:58.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Until WWDC, where I can finally shake hands with people and make some friendships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But with Twitter dying, and I shouldn't say dying, with the idea of Twitter dying in my</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:08.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">head, I think I have taken some stock and been like, you know, I do have friendships.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:14.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've alluded to it, but like I have, I talk to you outside of Twitter in eye message,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we've met in person before, like I have some friends out of that, you know, singular</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">group.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:25.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it is a thing that that does exist that I do have going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:31.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That being said, I still think there's just so much value in the community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Also, I want to help people that are trying to do what I'm doing or what I did right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If I can help, we've talked about Russ, I think, on the show already, but Russ Shanahan,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he was one of the first people that while I was tweeting about the beta, I have no idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how he found me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But he gave me a bunch of feedback and it was encouraging and helped sort of bring me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to do that for people as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if Twitter is not going to be where that lives,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to at least have some presence wherever that is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I've like jumped on the mastodon bandwagon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:08.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have lots of thoughts on the actual viability</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of that as a platform.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But the reality is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:17.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like there's this sort of amorphous entity</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:22.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that is the iOS network, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is just a blob of connections between people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was really focused on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, you and I are probably in multiple Slack groups</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with a bunch of random iOS people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe some Discord, some group chats.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But every one of those, what it's full of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is links to Twitter, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Like, oh, absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Like a lot of times,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the group chat is where you put your takes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you don't want to, you know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Tweet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because you're trying to get feedback from people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You don't want to say something embarrassing, whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's sort of the glue that holds it together.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And with Twitter's insanity right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that a more-fist blob, it has not moved wholesale to Massada.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think a lot of people on Massada feel like it has.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's fractured into these two groups,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but there's a lot of threads connecting them right now anyway.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm keeping like a foothold in both.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm not sure Macedon is where things will land,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I do think that if this is a network</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you care about, having something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to bring you along to wherever it lands is helpful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think Twitter will exist long enough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that if something else hits,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people will talk about it on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then that's where, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where people will go whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I literally put the section header for this Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's get our feelings out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think that's what I'm doing here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it freaks me out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I have more calm than I did</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in part because of that acceptance of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I'm more established than I,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at the surface level, feel like I am.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I think I can find my way into whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wherever we land.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there's a lot of new people coming in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:19.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I want that channel for us to like us as a community to develop new, interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">talent and people to keep going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I don't think that's a given.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:28.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think there are development communities where it doesn't exist, especially not in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">indie scene.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And a big part of me and you probably being able to get into this like we did is people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who are already in it, being really open and talking to us and giving us feedback and talking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about just what they're doing and us learning from them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'd like that to continue in whatever form that needs to take.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, long story short, I wanted to survive and go on because there's just truly no</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">place like Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think the other weird thing that I'll add, because I mean, I act of the same kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of things that you're saying, it definitely feels tangibly different right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we know we were joking about this on the group chat.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, of course, we're not like in it for like engagement, but for lack of a better word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It feels like people just aren't really using it as much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We joke back and forth, I tweeted something like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got one like, or you tweeted something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that got one or two likes to, and it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then I looked the other day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I lost like two or 300 followers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which again, it's not something that I stay up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think about, but it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you visit your profile every now and then to find a tweet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you see the number go down and you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, whoa, so it's like all these weird things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are happening, and we're just in this weird phase</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where we have to wait for it to settle down</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and who knows how long that's gonna take</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of see what's gonna happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really hope people stick around and don't leave,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:49.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I kind of joke that I've gone through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all the stages of brief with Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, tour, now I'm at acceptance.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:55.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, if people wanna go to Massed on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">go for it and I hope it works great,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's just like at the ripe old age of 34,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm almost like, I'm just too old</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for like another social network.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I just can't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I love what we have going on Twitter with the community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I hope that the prevailing thought will be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that the collective people are what make Twitter great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you could hate or love whoever runs it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's run the game since Twitter has existed,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:23.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with every CEO.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But we are the people that are there are what make it good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I have a mute list that's as long as my book series</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like I've almost got Twitter down to where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't see the stuff that drives me nuts anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I really don't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can find it if you want,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that was like the sweet spot for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think a lot of people are worried</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like those kinds of bad things will come in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And hopefully that they don't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nobody wants that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I hope that it just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just like we make Twitter fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Not who owns it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm holding onto that thought.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So hopefully it'll survive under that notion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, at next year's anticipated,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">highly anticipated Christmas special.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it'll be fun to revisit this conversation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">see what's happening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's actually a good point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It'll be interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:17.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm a lot more hopeful about the community as a community just existing somewhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think even this recent Macedon thing has shown people can jump ship and do the same types</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of things that they do somewhere else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:33.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so in some capacity, in like you said, blogs were kind of the name of the game before</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's plenty of different ways of doing blogging that'll work and yeah, you already have like a great blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a destination for people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it'll I think it'll it'll all work out in the end</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:50.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just a it's a weird time and it's a weird time with lots of deep emotions for lots of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah, which doesn't you know doesn't help with the discourse maybe but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah at the end of the day. I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Having some mechanism you've been a great example for me and I've been trying to do it although.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:16.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how successfully but like trying to just constantly talk about what you're doing share out your ideas be vulnerable with the reality of your situation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's really what helps bring people along.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And makes all of us I think better at what we do and so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I think there's ways that will continue to do that even without Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm with you, I think Twitter to me is still the one that I actually like more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just hope that, you know, the current ownership doesn't just completely destroy it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:45.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you know, personally, that's funny for me because I think I've</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">blocked about this one time, but like I've been like big boy pants responsible with the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">book money, you know, saved a lot of it, used it for family. And the only like me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:59.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">me purchase I did was I bought a Tesla because my car went out around the same time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's funny when I say that love.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't buy the crazy insane.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:05.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just bought the lowest model, like the most affordable one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When I was looking at other cars, there were toyo-tas and Chevy's that cost more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got the Tesla and I love it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's so weird because it's like, how can this person who makes this product that I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is so great which he's overblown a ton of promises to, which obviously with the self-driving</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, can he do this with like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is he gonna make Twitter like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">can he handle that like social media and cars</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are not the same thing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I just keep thinking of my head like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:36.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he's gotta be this billionaire for a reason, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, is there some method to his madness?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's gonna be really funny to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or fun slash funny slash disheartening slash scary slash,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all these other emotions to just see</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what in the world is gonna happen with Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I just, I have no idea what an Elon Musk Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">looks like, to be honest, from a product standpoint.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think we have an idea of that at this point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is Blue Check works for everybody.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause it made him.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, that's not a great start.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, right, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I won't get deep on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but is there a method to his madness?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The method might be,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I start out with a large amount of money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as the main entry point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- True.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And then madness ensues,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but somehow you can turn that larger amount of money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into more money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's crazy what a large amount of money can do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to start something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:24.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Exactly, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's worth the start something apparently.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, yeah, anyway, I don't want to get too deep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into that specifically, but yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Tesla's a good example of a similar thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, why does it, why does he have to be so public?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how many products do I own?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How many products sitting in front of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are me buying them or helping bad people?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how many CEOs of these major companies</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are people that I like the way that they act?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Even the high phones, a great example.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, if you've read the book on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the actual sweat and blood it takes to make an iPhone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wish we could put it in the show notes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:55.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe I'll message after you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it came out like two or three years ago.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was just a book on like the cost,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the human cost to make an iPhone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's crazy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the raw materials and the mining stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like that, yeah, that's one example right there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But we don't ever think of it that way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Most CEOs don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">aren't just like publicly broadcasting their crazy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, thanks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And I guess that is a very big difference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and it's almost nerve wracking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to talk about it on a podcast, you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh yeah, I'm about to get into."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- What are you confiding?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You just have to say it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how crazy all of this is though,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:30.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause it is wild.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Now that we've gotten all of our feelings out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the fire over here is slowly dying.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's time to let you, I think you're about to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're about to start your sort of yearly vacation, aren't you?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're gonna disappear from the internet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, started today, yep.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Turnin' off Twitter, doin' all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Got my video game for the year picked out.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:05.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm I'm ready to go by the way the book is called the one device the secret history of the iPhone. Okay perfect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's back in the journal</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, so I I would think of no better way to start my vacation than our yearly a fireside chat</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yep, yep, awesome. Well, I guess I'll end it the way I always do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:24.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is where can people find you and your work Jordan take a guess right? Yeah, Twitter</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.760</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.400</p>
