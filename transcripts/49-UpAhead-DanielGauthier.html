<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm Charlie Chapman, and today I'm excited</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to bring you the developer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">behind the delightful countdown app up ahead, Daniel Gauthier.</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(upbeat music)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:25.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Daniel, welcome to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Hey, thanks so much for having me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- This is gonna be a weird one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because normally I have people on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a lot of times it's the first person,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">first time I've met them outside of Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've talked before and also I've been following you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through this whole process of making this app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very, very excited.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've been looking forward to recording this episode</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for I feel like for a very long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm excited to get into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I'm gonna have to make sure I'm not just retelling you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all the same stories I've told you before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's gonna be a bit tricky, but we'll make it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, we'll make it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But before we get into Up Ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's give everybody else a primer on who you are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the three questions I always ask everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is where are you from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then we can talk about your career</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">leading up to Up Ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so first of all, I'm from Ottawa,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is in Ontario, which is in Canada.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Grew up here, I live here now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's sort of a, it's the capital of Canada,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's sort of a mid-sized city.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I grew up in Ottawa,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I ended up going to school in Southwestern Ontario near Toronto,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a school called Western in London, Ontario.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then lived in and around Toronto for a little while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but then moved back here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Still have lots of family and friends here and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's where I'm at right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In terms of education,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess I touched on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At Western, I did a weird double major in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">both computer science and a degree called popular music,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is not, it wasn't sort of your traditional like performance oriented music degree. It was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">more about music production and music history and sort of, you know, the cultural impacts of music.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it was this really weird sort of split between, you know, lots of hard math and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">computer science stuff and like this really sort of broad degree about, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">comparative literature and postmodernism and music production and just like...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's quite the contrast. It sort of lives at the intersection of computer science and liberal</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">arts. I feel like that's becoming like a joke on the show now. It's surprising how many people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">live at those crossroads it feels like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know. I certainly really appreciated that. I don't know that it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was the most like practical choice. But yeah, I was never really super - how do I put this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't wanna say not engaged, but not super interested in computer science for its own</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sake.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've always been interested in computers and it seemed like a sensible path to explore,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was also very much into music and I really wanted to continue to stretch the creative</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">side of my brain.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that kind of let me do that in these weird, sort of vague ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So out of college then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you immediately dove into the lucrative career of music studies, I assume.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">[LAUGHTER]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Well, that was the funny thing is, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have no idea who the other people even were in that degree.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think a couple of people were actually really into</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">music production and actually went on and made a career of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that was never really going to be a part of where I headed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think probably going into it, I wasn't sure about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think what I was trying to do as a high school student trying to figure out what I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was going to do with my life is I was trying to leave music open as a door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe there was some way I could leave that door open and somehow combine programming</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with music in some interesting way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or even, I'm sure at the time, I still had a notion that maybe I could somehow become</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a music producer or whatever that means.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, but yeah, pretty quickly through school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I realized like that's not - I'm interested in that stuff but that's not really where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my career is going to take me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So basically, once I finished school, I kind of had no idea what I was going to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I graduated in 2012 and I think partly because of the time and also maybe just partly because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the degree in the school, I kind of came out of that degree with a base of computer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">science but no real practical skills.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of came out not really having any idea how I wanted to apply those skills or even</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like where I could apply those skills.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you know, sort of through those four years at school, I started to get really interested</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the App Store and in iPhones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think my first iPhone was an iPhone 4, which was, I don't know, something like 2011.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I had like an iPod Touch before that and was very into, you know, all those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">early games, like big doodle jump fan. Yeah, all that good stuff. So yeah, I just like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started to become really interested in app development, but had no real like, through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">school, I basically didn't didn't really apply myself in any way to anything other than school,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which like, in hindsight, probably wasn't the right thing to do. I was very focused</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on school and focused on getting good grades. And I write just not not not having really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">applied all that stuff in any real way. So all that to say after school, I basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had had some like good part-time jobs in school doing kind of like research</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through the school and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I had a bit of money saved up and I basically decided to just take a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to teach myself iOS development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically after school, I sat down, I think I literally like went to a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bookstore and bought a book about, you know, like how to, how to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for iOS five or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you just decided like, I want to make iPhone apps as kind of a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is what I want to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Pretty much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't a job opportunity.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was like, no, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just, this is something I want to pursue.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have no idea how to do it right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm going to go figure out how to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Why iPhone apps?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I think there are a couple of things going on there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:18.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One is I think I had this sort of ill-defined notion that I wanted to somehow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like get into the startup scene, whatever that meant, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There was, there was all this energy, especially around that time around the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">store and around, you know, like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people having these little app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ideas and them blowing up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into these lucrative</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">businesses and lots of startups</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">popping up all over the place and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">often mobile was becoming a bigger</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and bigger part of like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">startup scene.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, yeah, I think part of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of young and naively just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of wanted to get into that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I don't think I really knew</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what that meant, but I knew I had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to figure out how to how to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">apps if I wanted to be involved in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">any of that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think the other aspect of it too is just like, I think it goes back a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:09.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to my two degrees and those two sides that I was trying to balance, which is that I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">think I really wanted to just shuffle into...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I never really know how to put this because I don't want to downplay any interesting work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that programmers who don't build apps are doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I didn't just want to go and be a programmer somewhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was really interested in like the creative side of building apps for people who could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like get them into their hands, you know, and certainly the design aspect of it too</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was really interesting to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The craft of computer science as a thing wasn't as interesting as, you know, what computer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">science could then create afterwards.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think I always tried to think about, yeah, programming as just a means to an end,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess like a tool that I can wield to build cool stuff rather than, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something that I'm really interested in for its own sake.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I definitely, that's, that's how I feel too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I get that same feeling sometimes where it's like, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you don't want to be like there is an art form and a cool stuff to programming</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too. It's just for whatever reason, it doesn't hit the same,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the same notes for me in terms of like things that you would do on your own on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the side and get you really excited.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And interestingly, I think as I've as I've gotten older and sort of navigated</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this career, I think I think some of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some of that stuff has become more interesting to me in some ways, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I, you know, I think there's so much that I didn't really understand about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of the craft of programming itself that has become more interesting to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I have like explored deeper in the years since.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, long story short, it's just like apps were really cool to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was really sort of energized and excited by them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I sort of had this weird blank slate opportunity where I was just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, I have no idea what I'm going to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this seems like the coolest thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm going to try and do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you go straight into trying to do something independent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or did you find a job relatively quickly?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No. So I spent a year without a job working on my own projects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I built the first project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm trying to actually think what I tried to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think initially I did the classic beginner thing of like to do app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What I was gonna say is like I went way too</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Big I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Had the I had these notion that these ideas of just like I was gonna I honestly don't remember what the app idea was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wish I did but I had I remember like sitting in my parents basement the summer after</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">after I graduated from school with like this iOS book open on the desk.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Meanwhile, I was trying to learn Ruby on Rails because I was just deep down this rabbit hole.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, well, I'm going to need to build a website and I'm going to need to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a back-end and I'm going to need to do this and this and this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no idea what I was doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At a certain point, thankfully,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not too far into it, I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Okay, I need something simpler.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to cut scope a little bit here."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So at that point, I realized,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">okay, this is going to be more of a learning journey than like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to go and build something great and ship it to the world,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and this is going to be my new job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What I ended up doing is the first app I ever built was an app called Sixth Note.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't even know if I can remember why I called it that exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the gist of the app is that it was a journaling app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the sort of hook was that you could attach music to your journal entries.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it had an actual music player built into it such that like if you were listening to music,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you could open up this app and you'd see the music that was playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if you wrote an entry, that music would automatically be linked to your journal entry.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that if you went and reviewed entries later, you could like hit play on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it would play the music that you were listening to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Listening to on your phone?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- How did it know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, it's just like, what was music even called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it was just like the iTunes app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you have hooks into--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, okay, I didn't realize that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so there were ways to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of like third party music players</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you could just like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">build your own controls to, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to show what was actually playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so that's how you made your first million then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(both laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's all been smooth sailing from there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, anyway, so like I spent a long time on that app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like, so this was objective C days</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it was also just barely post-arc days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when I actually started building this thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was actually having to learn specifically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about like retain cycles and how to release things properly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you actually understand all that then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I guess so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Although again, like I was in so deep at that point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I had no idea what I was doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on so many different axes that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how much I was really absorbing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And certainly if you go and look at that code,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just like, I have no idea what's happening in here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, anyway, so that was just like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this interesting project where I was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was interacting with a whole bunch of different,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, like first party APIs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I, of course then I kept sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">scope creeping this thing where you could also add</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">photos to your entries and well you could also add your location to your entries and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was a great learning app idea right because I was just interacting with so many different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things and having to figure out how to piece all this stuff together. Yeah. Yeah. So anyways</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I released this first app and I mean yeah nothing happened of course. Did you have expectations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">going into it. I think I probably did have some like so just some very naive expectations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">based on just like a total misunderstanding of how this stuff works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And certainly the app store did work differently at the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like at that time, if for some reason I had somehow managed to get an app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feature, things would have been very different. Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Not so much the case now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I had. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just had no concept of like, you know, what that would take,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what it meant to at all try to market your work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I just kind of put it out and I crossed my fingers and was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I hope people find this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And of course, people can't find it. Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just not how it works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also, to be clear, the quality also just wasn't there, of course.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was the first thing I'd ever built. It was kind of this weird Frankenstein</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mishmash of strange UI ideas and half-baked design.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:39.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so-- but again, it's just like it was such a great way to just hone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I was actually trying to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, enough about Sixth Note.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I then turned around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that probably took me something like six months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I turned around and was like, all right, well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now I kind of know what I'm doing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to make something else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I made a two-player word game that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was managed through Game Center called Switchboard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was-- yeah, so you took turns basically placing--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually, how did it work?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Gosh, this is so long ago now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was sort of boggle-like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you had a bunch of words on a grid,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you were trying to-- or sorry,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a bunch of letters on a grid, and you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">were trying to pick the letters off of the grid</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to create a good word, a good long word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then if you created that word,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was basically like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You were trying to capture areas on the board.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So by using letters,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">those letters would turn your color.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then if the other person used those letters,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they would turn back to neutral.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there was this, you're going back and forth trying to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">create words that would capture the right areas of the board.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, to this day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm still fairly proud of that one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's amazing just getting through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sixth note and all the mess that that was and figuring out what I was doing and then coming</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out the other end and starting fresh. Yeah, it just made a huge difference. Like I kind of felt</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, OK, I actually sort of know what I'm doing. I actually have some sort of identity that I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to chase with this app. I actually kind of know what I want it to look like and how it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">should feel and how everything should fit together. So certainly if you go look at old pictures of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that app, it was definitely a pretty blatant. I don't want to say rip off because the game</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was different, but aesthetically it was very, very similar to a letterpress. I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like that era I missed this era because I was in the Android land, but everybody references</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">letterpress. It seemed like everybody like was what was the name of this one by the way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was gonna add a link in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Switchboard. Yeah, I don't know that you'll find much evidence of it anymore on the internet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And letterpress was shoot what's his name the Tweety Lauren Brichter right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Lauren Brichter yeah. Yeah so that was just again it was just one of those sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">famous App Store stories that as a young upstart dev, you're like, Okay, well, I can do that. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want to do that, right? Like, there must be some way that I can also have like a mega hit on my</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:58.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hands and somehow have millions of people playing my game. Which again, of course, that didn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">happen. Not even close. But yeah, again, like I said, I mean, I was a lot more proud of that one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:10.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did have some like, I did find a little bit of traction, just, just in the sense of like people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who weren't friends and family. I actually saw them playing it a little bit like there were more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:21.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">users than just you know the 10 people I asked to try my app. Yeah. Anyway so that was something it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:26.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was something interesting to me. I was like OK maybe maybe there's something here I can continue</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do. Basically after that I decided all right it had been about a year. It's time to get a job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll kind of blow through some of this pretty quickly but basically I did end up trying. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I continued to have that idea of like I want to be in the startup world, I want to join</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some like high octane startup and do that whole thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, yeah, the first job I ever had without getting into too much details was just a bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of a mess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was a lot of young people who had no idea what they were doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I spent way too much time working.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:07.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the culture was very much just like, you know, work all day and then work all evening. And then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you want work all night and then continue to work all day. And and yeah, that was just very</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:19.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">much the vibe for no real reason. You know, in retrospect, it was just like, I didn't know any</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:25.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">better. Exactly. It's just like, OK, well, I guess this is how this is. And, you know, there were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:31.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">plenty of good people there and I definitely had fun. But yeah, things went nowhere there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was at, so I was at this small startup for about a year and a half. From there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">jumped to another little startup in Toronto. That one was a lot more interesting and sort of legit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:47.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this little company called Volley. And we basically built, it's sort of stack overflow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">adjacent. It was a way for people to ask questions and get answers from a community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was more centered around sort of like the business community, like small businesses and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">startups and stuff. And so I was sort of a Oh, I guess one thing I should mention in both of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these cases is I was the one and only iOS developer, okay, which has kind of been a weird</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">theme of my career is I, I've rarely had the opportunity to sort of join a big team and learn</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from people who know what they're doing. Like I came off of a year of just banging my head against</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to books and trying to figure out how to build apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I, you know, wandered into these jobs where it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">OK, you're the iOS developer, go and build our app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just continued to kind of learn by doing and had no idea really what I was doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that can be a good way to learn, too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because you know, yeah, the amount of responsibility that you have,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even if the company ultimately doesn't quite succeed, is still quite huge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you're having to think about and deal with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's the breadth versus depth thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like at a big company, you can go really deep and learn from people and learn</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a something, you know, really, really well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But oftentimes at a big company, you're never going to look at app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">connector, you're not going to learn about, you know, build systems or any of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that stuff, because that's not your responsibility.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And, uh, yeah, when it's all you, it's all you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, so yeah, I worked at Volley.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like a fairly, fairly short stint.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that company sort of pivoted, I guess, in 2015.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's the point at which I came back to Ottawa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:25.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, then to sort of wrap up this, the story of how my career has gone, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I spent a bit of time or sorry, not a bit of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I spent a significant amount of time, about three and a half years at a company</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here in Ottawa called Shoebox, which is a really cool company that basically built</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hearing tests for iPads.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, if anybody has ever had their hearing tested, like gone and visited</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an audiologist, traditionally what you do is you end up in this big sort of sound booth</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:54.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it can be this kind of uncomfortable experience to sort of like respond to cues and get your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hearing tested.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was basically this little game you could play on an iPad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You just put on a calibrated set of headphones, play this game and it was - they were actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:09.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like - this was a medical company, like these were medically valid results that, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">could use to modernize their practice and make it a lot cheaper, but also we sold to...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:20.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a lot of industries where maintaining employees' hearing health is really important</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:26.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">legally. And so, like construction, military, a lot of companies in those types of industries</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had a real interest in this type of product where they could quickly and easily test employees'</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hearing. Anyway, so yeah, there I was finally at more of a... Still a small company, but more of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of an established company, joined an existing team. And yeah, by the end of it was kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:46.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">leading the iOS side of that company. And then yeah, maybe I'll sort of stop there. Because at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:53.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that point, once I left that company, that's when I started to finally get back into independently</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:00.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developing apps. Yeah. Is this is this the point when you decided to start your blog, the like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">going in the blog series?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, pretty much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So so I left shoebox</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the summer of twenty nineteen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just totally burnt out like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Again, that was that was a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">great company, great people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I was just I was trying to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too much there for too long.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just kind of hit a wall at a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">certain point where it's just like I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">can't I can't keep doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this. So I just kind of quit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">cold turkey. I had no</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">nothing lined up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Having quit that job, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of just had this idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I could do some consulting work for a little while. And to be fair, I did have some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like contacts that I figured I could get some work through pretty quickly. So it wasn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a complete like dive off the deep end by quitting that job. But yeah, and then I also kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">recommitted, I still had, you know, this whole time I'd had this idea in the back of my head</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it'd be really nice to actually, you know, give building my own apps another go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I kind of like started and stopped through the years, right? Like through these sort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of startup years, I would try to spin up my own projects, and I just sort of run out of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">steam, don't have time to commit to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, don't have any idea how to actually like, you know, I built two apps at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, I have no idea how to market these things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really know, like, why I'm doing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, so I kind of Yeah, having left that job in 2019, I kind of wanted to recommit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a little bit to get an app out into the world again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And just and yeah, sort of, I guess, get my name out there a little bit too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as like somebody who could actually build things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as a solo developer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's what, so I mentioned that blog series.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You like wrote a series on, it's amazing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's worth reading now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was going back through reading it again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in prep for this and it's, one, it's entertaining,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but two, it's like, anybody who's done this has,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">obviously everybody has very different experiences,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but a lot of the feelings are the same</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this series in particular talks a lot about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the feelings of trying to do the whole indie thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did the idea of doing this come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because this came before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean I know it came before Obather,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your first, or not your first app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the app coming up I guess in the story came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But was it, were you working on Obather</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you started the blog series?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or what was the order there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I guess really the question is, why did you do it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, Obather certainly wasn't the first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of idea I had for an app to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in this period of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had actually started down a path of building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a sort of, yeah, without getting into too much details,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">basically a sort of grocery list type of app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had some interesting ideas that I wanted to explore</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just around like sort of building an app around what you already have at home like building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it around what's in your pantry and managing that rather than sort of managing recipes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:03.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you know grocery lists specifically. So I had actually like pretty seriously started</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">down that road. I think when I started writing the blog posts I think that is actually the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:16.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app I sort of had in mind that I was actively working on. Yeah. To answer your question</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:30.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">why I started writing. I think like, so one part of it is just, I knew I needed an actual</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">way to reach people. Because I had learned that you can't just not try to reach anybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then release an app and expect it to reach somebody. I started to get more active on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter and I think just yeah from from that lens I figured writing about my experiences just being</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">honest about what I was doing might sort of draw people in a little bit get people invested in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I was actually trying to build. So yeah that's just kind of the like I guess businessy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">answer but I've also always loved to write I mean back to school like a big part of that weird broad</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pop music literature degree was actually writing you know like I did a lot of writing in school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I took a bunch of English courses and writing courses.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I think alongside a lot of my big ideas about building my own apps over the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">years, I had also often had these big ideas about, you know, like writing for an audience,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having some sort of blog that had an audience and enjoying that process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it just kind of felt like a natural thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It felt like and it just felt like a way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In some ways, it was almost like a bit of a defense because the tone of that blog is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very much like, I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't know if this is gonna work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually I probably think it's not gonna work, but hey, we're gonna give it a shot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think like it actually, yeah, if I'm being blunt, I think it was a bit of a defense</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mechanism, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To just...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know what?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That tracks so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's part of what draws people like me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to both the blog, but also a lot of the stuff you do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like your humor has that sort of like Chandler</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from "The Friends" like self-deprecating</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">defense mechanism thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you almost are incapable of being sincere</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a way that's very, what's the word I'm looking for?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I mean, I'm looking for the word</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for I am the exact same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like we're jumping ahead a little bit, but even like the way you announced up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ahead was something like, I'm here to save the world with this countdown app or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:47.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, it's like you're getting out ahead of like, I'm going to say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something sincere, but like, I know this is a business and please don't, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hate me for it or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's, that's really interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's funny.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's, it's a really, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have always found that to be a really tough balancing act to be honest.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's hard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it's really hard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, I mean, hearing you talk about this is a familiar feeling of like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:20.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can, you can look at the world and look at the sort of business plan that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're trying to go with and be like, all right, I know what I need to do to like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get attention, but then you also don't want to be that guy, you know, whatever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that guy means in your head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's really hard to be sincere without draping everything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in apologies for being sincere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I think taking the like silly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">goofy approach around it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lets you do that without it being annoying in the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is interesting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I feel like I'm just on the annoying side usually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where I just qualify everything too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I think that's a pretty solid analysis</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of my entire Twitter brand at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So, okay, so before we get into "Oh, Bother Itself" then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">did it work?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, do you feel like writing the way that you were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was worth it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, absolutely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for genuinely a couple reasons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It did work in the sort of cynical sense</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it did garner some attention,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Specifically, I wrote one post at some point about imposter syndrome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which I don't think is really even the right term for what I was writing about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, but if you want SEO, that's the word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was basically writing about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to some extent, I'm writing about exactly what we're talking about right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That post was very much about like the extremely uncomfortable feeling</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like trying to put yourself out there on Twitter and trying to get people's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">attention as somebody who's not typically an attention seeker.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, and yeah, that did garner, you know, some some interest.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, cynically, sure, I gained some followers through doing that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But genuinely, I also like, actually really enjoyed that process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:20.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wrote quite a bit for a while there over the span of about a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All those posts had like these very silly drawings and I cannot say enough like anybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">listening, you should seriously just I'll have a link in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">worth reading, they're entertaining. And if you're anything like me, at least, it's nice to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">see somebody else feeling the same way that you feel about these things. Yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, well, thank you. And yeah, so that so they were, they're just a lot of fun to write. And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to this day, I still, I lament the fact that I haven't written now in about two years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was going to be my biting follow up question is then why have you not?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, you know, done it going forward.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the answer is literally just time. I really want to have been writing this whole time. I am</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">currently thinking about this is jumping way ahead, but I think I'm going to try to write</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something about the up ahead process. I think there's a lot of interesting stuff to write</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about there. But basically, the last post in that little blog series was, it was me writing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like very broadly about, I guess about 2020.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Almost all of this took place in 2022.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - 2020 as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Can't say 2022.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So yeah, the last thing I wrote was basically like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just had a baby and you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I don't have time to do anything anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, hopefully I can get back to it at some point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And as of now, I have not gotten back to it yet, but.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's all caps, or not all caps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but exclamation point, identity crisis.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, that's the one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so that's when I ended up going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and getting a real job again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so, okay, so rewinding a little bit then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through this process of writing these,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you, sounds like, pivoted and started up a new app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which eventually became "Oh, Bother."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So what's the sort of story there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so the story, that is very much a pandemic story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So basically I was, so the timing here, again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started working on this weird sort of grocery app idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">late 2019, worked on it for a couple months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I was doing a lot of consulting work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this time too, so it certainly wasn't like a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it wasn't getting a ton of time and attention,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was chipping away at this new app idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then March 2020 happened,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which meant that my wife was working from home,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so it was no longer just me alone at home every day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing my work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we found that we were stepping</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on each other's toes a lot, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like just, you know, not realizing the other person was on a call and making a bunch of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">noise in the kitchen or just like, you know, going and talking to somebody right in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">middle of like when they're really deep in work or trying to finish a thought or whatever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it might be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I guess this sort of strange little idea just struck me and pretty quickly - well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually, maybe first I should talk about what the idea was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:16.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically, what Obother was, was a really simple way to let people know the idea was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">specifically your housemates, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So your spouse or your roommates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or whoever you're living with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let people know when you're botherable</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and when you're not botherable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think pretty quickly, I just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I realized, once that idea struck me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I sort of realized that this other app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had been chipping away at was going to take a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just, it's one of those app ideas that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, I could have continued on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it probably would have taken a year plus</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for me to get to any sort of finish line</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I would be happy with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's like a mature space,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so there's so many features that people consider baseline.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, when this little idea hit me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I pretty quickly decided, you know what,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just gonna try to build this thing in like a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I was getting a little bit impatient, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just wanted to get something out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I was trying to build a bit of momentum</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the blog and try to, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just get people interested in what I was building. I didn't want to drag that out for, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">18 months. So yeah, I decided to just try to build this little thing. I basically tried</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:27.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to - I tried pretty hard to timebox it to like a month. Like I really just poured effort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into it and tried to get it out the door in a month. I think I actually managed to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:39.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it in about a month and a half, which in retrospect makes no sense. Like I don't know how I did</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">especially coming off of Up Ahead, which took me like a year and a half.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, this is pre-baby.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was pre-baby and I didn't have a full-time job at the time. So I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">much more able to just kind of, yeah, put my head down and focus for big chunks of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Obather was just this fun little project. I will say I didn't have any grand illusions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with that one at all of like it catching on in any real way or making me any sort of real money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was very much like a, let's just get something out there. Let's like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">exercise those muscles again of like actually following something through and getting it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out the door. And again, hopefully, you know, get get some interest, get people interested in what</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:22.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was doing and like who I was as an independent developer, right, sort of what my, my sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:28.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">style was in building apps. And I do think it largely succeeded at that, like, I was really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">happy with the response I got from that. So I feel like I mean, it's still in the store, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I still have it on my phone. Yes. Yeah, it's still up there. I definitely feel like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:46.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it established a very unique, like your unique sort of visual style and playfulness. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because it was one of those apps where like my wife was a teacher. It didn't necessarily</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:58.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wasn't a required or useful thing for me for how I live my life. But I just loved playing with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that was the thing about it that really stood out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And especially with the crowd of people who are reading your blog and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">our other iOS developers, it was just a very inspiring piece of work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I almost called it a piece of art, which I guess is the thing I was meaning for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sounds too highfalutin, but it really is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:27.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You could feel the craft and personality in a way that really, really stood out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, well, thank you. And yeah, that was that was absolutely the intention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like, can I can I just narrow scope</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the nth degree, just like build this tiny thing, but really, really polish the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">heck out of it to just sort of show myself and other people sort of what I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">capable of. And that in that particular aspect of a building apps was just really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the stuff I love, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The stuff I care about and the stuff that I think I've continued to kind of hone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So did you treat this one, like you talked about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you'd started the blog in part with the idea of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to build a little bit of a following</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and use this as a way to market something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did you try to market this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did you talk to the press, try to push it out there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, short answer is no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the short answer is I basically relied entirely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on Twitter, which at the time wasn't a lot,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or like I didn't really have much of a following.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, no, I didn't really think about that too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in fact, I think I wrote a blog post</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that basically just like stepped through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of the weird things that happened after I launched it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I could have handled so much better</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I had like, you know, known what I was actually doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, I'm not sure how much any of this stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would have necessarily moved the needle on anything,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:56.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for example, you know, somebody reached out to me midday like Obather was actually on launch day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It gained quite a bit of traction.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sort of went quote unquote viral in the sort of small bubble that we that we operate in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, someone messaged me at some point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, hey, I just put your I just put Obather on product hunt.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like I think it ended up like at the top of product hunt that day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like I didn't even do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right. Like I didn't craft that page at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't get the chance to write it or like put my own screenshots in there or anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just somebody who threw it up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and then I kind of scrambled to, you know, try to respond to questions on there and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:33.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Similar thing happened with like the, all the, uh, Apple subreddit Sunday stuff where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, I, I really dragged my feet on that and then it took hours for it to get through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the mods and then it did get through, but it was like the end of Sunday at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, I, yeah, timing is, uh, well, everything with that subreddit is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It feels like luck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, getting it early,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">getting lucky that for some reason</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it doesn't get taken down.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But I will say that that one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there is a potential upshot that's pretty high.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I mean, I got a little bit of traction there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but again, I just sort of didn't really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like control that properly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At some point, like I wrote about the process</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of building this thing and it ended up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quite highly ranked on Hacker News at one point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like I didn't even have a Hacker News account.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I started to try to answer questions on Hacker News and then I got rate limited</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like immediately.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They were just like, "You're posting too many comments."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I couldn't answer any more questions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just all this stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just sort of a comedy of errors and me trying to react to what had happened instead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of having any cogent plan.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I mean, learning experience, I guess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I learned what not to do to some extent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But again, it also wasn't really my motivation to have this sort of breakout and have a bunch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of people use it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because honestly, I never really had...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think I was right about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:07.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I never really thought that it was an app that had legs as anything more than what you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of mentioned, as something that is playful and fun to play with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, oh, this is really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like a fun idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was topical, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because the pandemic had just started.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's part of why.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's some novelty.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it had some legs initially, but I just aside from, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are definitely some people who I think still use it today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like it's not the type of app that's really sticky for most people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would be hard to build a business off of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The last thing with Obata then is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You got that like Apple themselves tweeted about it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is a hilarious story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll tell it here. So</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is sort of another example of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just reacting to things happening and not having any idea what's going on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So initially I did get get sort of the standard</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like generated email from Apple that's like, we may feature your app in the App</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Store. Yeah. So send us your assets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I'm like scrambling to download Photoshop</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because apparently they only accept Photoshop files.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I have no idea how Photoshop works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I did all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that any of that was ever actually used.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:23.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then a few days later, my dad texts me and forwards me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:23.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an email.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And he's like, I got this weird email about your app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really know what it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's just like this completely sort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of unofficial looking email addressed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to my dad, like with his first name, it's like, hello.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a different first name than yours.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, you know, we're I don't remember what the exact wording was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's like, we're going to feature, you know, your app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, bother on Apple's social media accounts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So send us a demo video that you'd like us to use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's just like and it was just like no, like no official looking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">anything whatsoever, just like some person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the some person had an Apple address and I looked them up on LinkedIn and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">managed to find them and it was some sort of person who seemed to actually work at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Apple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I couldn't really figure out like it just it looked like total spam but I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">couldn't really figure out how anyone would benefit from me sending them a 30</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">second demo of my app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:25.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I was just like all right well first of all I don't know why you sent this to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my dad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how you know my dad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that to this day that makes no sense to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like no sense to me at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I ended up sending them this video and then sure enough, like the next day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:44.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. From like the app store, like the official Apple app store, Twitter account</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tweeted specifically about Obather.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think it got posted on Facebook as well, which was really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, that that account has millions of followers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a pretty neat, a neat thing to have happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's like ignoring whatever results that might have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of a validating feeling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did now, did it have any impact on sales?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nope.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Really?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, like really, like really not, really not at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was shocked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is very, that actually is really surprising to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now that was a paid up front app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, bother was free.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just basically had a little like plus tier inside and a tip jar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That legitimately surprises me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was really strange.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You'd really think that like that's hitting a lot of eyeballs</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a lot of people are going to click through.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Like I get that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not you know, it's not like a traditional marketing channel,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how many people are really following it and what level of intent would they have?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But still, just the the size of the net</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And what I assume being a small indie app project,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's not like you had this massive, you know, user base.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You'd think you'd notice a decent bump.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's interesting. Huh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I mean, there were certainly there was some sort of bump.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, it's just like really, really not at all what I would have expected.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's like probably a difference of like maybe a thousand,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">couple thousand downloads, maybe,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and certainly not translating into much in terms of in-app purchases.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very, very cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:29.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, maybe you're not like this, but the couple of features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:33.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in that vein that I've gotten before, although I've never had that, it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's the type of thing that your family that isn't technical.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It kind of like feels like, no, no, for real.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, look, you can go to their official page and it has the thing that I made.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I actually do real things. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:59.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome. Okay, so Oh, bother. Definitely a success story, I would say for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From your perspective. There was obviously there was a law we've mentioned that you had a baby</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this point in between, but like, did you come off of Oh, bother saying like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All right, I'm going to start my next thing. Or were you kind of like, I'm taking a break.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was back and forth on this a little bit. But I certainly wanted to do more with Oh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:22.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bother than I ended up doing. I had I had plans to continue to chip away at that for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a little while. Add some additional features to it like the specific thing that I actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">got really close to finishing building and it's I'm sad it never got out the door but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted to build some calendar integration so that you know you could hook up at the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">start of the day you could just sort of like import when your meetings were and it would</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">automatically flip you from unbotherable to botherable throughout the day based on your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:51.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">calendar. So yeah, I had some ideas like that that I wanted to continue working on. So I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to think about what the timeline was here again. But I guess I think I'll bother shipped</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">somewhere sort of like summer, like early summer 2020. And yeah, I became a dad in September of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">2020. So there wasn't really a lot of time there before everything just kind of changed for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:16.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right? It's just like, yeah, my time kind of went out the window. And yeah, I think at a certain</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">point, I don't know exactly when, but I just kind of resigned myself to the fact that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know what, like, I think Obothers kind of find the way it is. And it's probably not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:31.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something you know, with my more limited time now, it's probably not something worth continuing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to work on again, because like I had, unlike when I actually built Obother in around September</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:46.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of 2020 I got back into full-time work. So that plus a kid was just sort of a complete</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">change to my ability to actually do any work on that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's fast forward. So you at that point, you know, you get back into full-time work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you're you're doing that happily getting no sleep at all, but you have a little bundle</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of joy with you. So we fast forward, I guess a couple years and then how does up ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or some kind of project end up coming into being?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you looking for a project again?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or like, what's the origin story here?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- What is the origin story of Up Ahead?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I was in search of a new project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's probably the best way to put it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I said, I kind of decided Up Ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably was not sort of the thing to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it wasn't the thing for me to try to take the next step.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whatever like ambiguous next step that is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like in terms of trying to get more users,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to build something better,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to become a better independent app developer,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oba, there probably wasn't going to be the thing to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, at a certain point once life calmed down a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it was summer of 2021.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think I was pretty much just searching for a project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So much that I think at a certain point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I actually remember sitting down and just working on not an app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like an app that didn't actually do anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:04.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just playing with UI and just building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">different sort of, yeah, like imagining different ways I could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like style an app, like sort of different like directions I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">could go in for like how to design, you know, whatever I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wanted to design next without actually having any idea what it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was I wanted to build. But meanwhile, I guess the the very</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">simple sort of origin story of up ahead is just that I have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">always enjoyed counting down to things. I just find it's like a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">fun way to like give the future a bit of definition, a bit of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">color to be like, Oh yeah, like in three days I've got this random thing that I'm looking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whether it's, you know, a birthday or something as simple as just like, you know, a hockey</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">game I'm looking forward to watching or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how would you do that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would often just like have notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I usually use bear for note taking, but just like some note app where I would just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like write down things with dates on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, I'm imagining you have a note that's just a number and every day you'd wake up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an update on your number.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(both laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, no, it wasn't that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just a plain list of, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like events and dates I was looking forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, and I think like throughout the years,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'd often gone to the App Store and looked for apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would count down to things and just, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess classic story of just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was never really satisfied with anything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that was out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an extremely busy space.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Extremely noisy space on the App Store,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but there's just so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There are so many of them that are full of ads.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There are a lot of them that are really focused on widgets,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but sort of the actual in-app experience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is a little bit cumbersome</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just like not really interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, a lot of them are just really old</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and not really maintained anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So anyways, I just never really found anything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that tickled me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, at a certain point, I was just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, this might be a good...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess the other thing to mention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is I was certainly looking for another</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">fairly narrowly scoped project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- This certainly took me way longer than I thought it would,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm also certainly glad that it was as</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">relatively narrow in scope as it was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it took me a year and a half to get out what is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like at the end of the day, in some ways,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a pretty simple countdown app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm not building some huge, complicated product here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But like, given your sort of style,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:36.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keeping the scope narrow allows you to spend the obnoxious amount of time on the polish.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:41.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because that's like with all of your stuff, it's like that's what really makes it shine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not the amount of features, it's how well they're done.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and so yeah, I think I just sort of thought like a countdown app was a good vehicle</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:58.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for that, right? It's just like a slightly larger in scope than Obather. Also, probably</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quite a bit more useful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it felt more like the kind of app that actually might have legs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, the existence of a market kind of proves that out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:07.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So obviously the challenge there is actually getting noticed, which we can get into later.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it felt like a good vehicle for that next step to allow me to really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">polish things up, explore some interesting ideas around like a pretty simple core.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you have an initial hook?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:30.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I can already see the description of bear being a list of your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:38.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then what sort of the main skeleton of up ahead is it was that kind of the initial idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:45.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of what differentiated it? Yeah, the first thing that sort of piqued my interest in thinking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through this and thinking through what it could be and what could make it interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:55.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was sort of that main timeline view. At least all countdown apps I've ever seen the sort of in-app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:01.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">experiences really just here's a list of all the events you've created that you can then you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:11.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">spin widgets out of or whatever. And for me, I guess I think part of the reason I used my silly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:18.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">note instead of putting widgets on my home screen is because I think what I actually liked</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was not just knowing that there are X days until this event I'm looking forward to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but being able to look at the future more holistically, like look at the next -</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Up ahead, you might say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:37.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, look up ahead at the next three weeks and be like, oh man, there's like six things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'm looking forward to in the next three weeks and here's how they all fit in together,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right? And oh, these are like back to back to back, that's going to be an awesome three days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:49.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that quickly became, I think, the sort of first differentiator for me. The first thing that I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:56.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to do is that timeline view that you see in up ahead now that actually shows you visually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of how many days are passing between events and gives you this really sort of attractive way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to actually scroll through your future events and also scroll through your past events too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, to sort of look back on on some of the fun things you've done over the past month or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or whatever it might be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you sort of just glossed over it, but the gap between the events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being different, depending on the realistic gap.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did that idea come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the very first screenshot I ever saw when you were working on this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had that in there, and it was kind of like a, oh, like mind blowing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of feeling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a simple concept, but yeah, I don't know exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I think I was just playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So here's what I will say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:45.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can remember playing with a few different UI ideas that weren't that before settling</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on that, but we're sort of versions of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:52.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can remember trying to mess around with like, what was I trying to do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was trying to like draw lines.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the events were stacked vertically, but I was trying to like just draw lines between</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if they were further apart, I was drawing like loopy lines, like having them sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">loop around to sort of...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Kind of like how messages does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I was, yeah, I was thinking about that a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But no, to be honest, I don't really know exactly where that idea came from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At some point, it probably just occurred to me, "Oh, it'd be cool if there was actually,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if this wasn't just a normal list, if you could actually, if there was some visual interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in here."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:33.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was tricky to get right at first, because initially, I just sort of naively tried to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do something where it's like, "Okay, well..."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if you look at the gaps between events and up ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's like these little segment, these line segments,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're kind of like dashed lines, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, okay, well, I guess maybe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could have each dash be worth a day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then immediately you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">okay, well, that's gonna be a terrible experience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause like if the first event I input</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like a birthday that's coming up in 200 days,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(both laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's kind of a silly scrolling experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I had to kind of hone that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or yeah, figure that out, figure out how to balance that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you have that visual separation,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it doesn't create just this sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">silly, annoying experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so you have the idea of a countdown app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You noodle on kind of a general design.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then you said you spent a year on this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was, I mean, that initial thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">seemed like that happened pretty quick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is me bringing some insider information in here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the year was a pretty long process of continual advancement.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:44.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What's like, what's kind of like walk through a little bit how that went?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was it that took so long?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If only I knew.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That sounded more tacky than I meant it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What indeed?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh my gosh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's honestly is painful to look back at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think it's my pinch tweet anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I probably changed it when we launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:09.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for a long time, my initial sort of announcement tweet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like, it's the thing you mentioned earlier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:15.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to save the world by building a Countdown app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you look at the screenshot attached to that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it looks really similar to what Up Ahead ended up being.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so on the surface, it's really painful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to look at that and go, I got to--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:32.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">basically, the entire timeline, that whole thing was built--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least, at least, yeah, on a surface level in like two weeks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was very excited and I was like, yeah, like, look at all this progress I'm making.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is going to be another Oh, bother. Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm going to have this thing out in two months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And why did it take so long?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, just time, full time job, evenings and weekends.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Kid, there's just not a lot of time to do this stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:56.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There were large stretches of time where I just, you know, wasn't making that much</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:01.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">progress because it's hard to balance all the things you want to do in life.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, more concretely, certainly wrangling dates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is difficult. That takes time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I hear.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so it's one thing to stand up a UI to the extent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you can take a screenshot of it and post it to Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and get some likes on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's another thing to actually make sure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of those weird edge cases are working properly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How are you handling recurring events?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how are you handling multi-day events?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And what if an event has a time set and one of it doesn't?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if the start date has a time set,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but for some reason the end date doesn't?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What if an event doesn't have an end date?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:44.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how do you actually order your timeline in such a way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that that always sort of feels organic and makes sense?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which if that's something-- if you've used Up Ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you haven't thought about that too much,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then hopefully I've done my job right,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because that's sort of the goal, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that I should all just feel--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're hiding the complexity.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, that's not a trivial thing to get right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then I think the other thing is to--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, honestly, we talked about Obather earlier</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and how it was kind of this cute little app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was very polished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">On the other hand, I do look at that app now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:20.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there are a lot of parts of that app that, to my eyes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">weren't particularly polished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I do think I took a big extra step with Up Ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where with Oh, bother, there were parts of it where I was just like, OK, this is good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">enough. Going to move on. I'm trying to you know, I'm trying to timebox this. I'm trying</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to get it at the door. And I think with up ahead, I I really just tried really hard to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:46.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">never do that. I really tried hard with up ahead. Every sort of new feature I built,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:52.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every new screen I built, I was really trying to kind of start from I don't know, from first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">principles, I guess, if I can say that and and figure out like, how do I make this particular</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:04.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing interesting? How do I make it actually fun, right? How do I tell people how to use</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">widgets and actually make it fun?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's where I was going to go. If anybody listening has not looked at the widget settings</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for Up Ahead, it is ridiculous in the best way possible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:22.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. So yeah, I think it's just like, the reason it took time is because every individual piece</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:27.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">took time, right? It's just like, I was spending a long time thinking through every screen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:33.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I want my settings to work? How do I want the filtering to work? How do I, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:38.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">iterated a lot on event creation, right? Like, how do I make sure that creating events feels</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:45.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">quick and easy and fun without, but also powerful enough to not feel, you know, like there's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:49.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">still, there's still, you still want to give people control there, right? Like they're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're still controlling what icon they want to use</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and have some pretty meaningful controls</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">around dates and the patterns.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I certainly iterated on that a lot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, short answer is I just think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every piece of that app just took time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Every time I thought, oh, this will be an easy screen,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this will be something I can just bang out quickly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that was never true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I always ended up pushing myself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do something a little bit different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- What was your test flight beta strategy for this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you seeding it out to a lot of people early on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or small group of people or?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Short answer is the test flight stayed pretty small</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until the very, very end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just very slowly brought more people in as I went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I just worried about a couple things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the test flight</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that probably weren't particularly well-founded,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was very cautious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not to bring too many people in too quickly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One, because I just didn't want to accidentally break</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a bunch of people's apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really wanted to make sure that when a lot of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had their hands on a beta, I wanted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to make sure I was confident that I could transition them</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">onto the real app and not break their data.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Accidentally be like, oh, oops, all your data is gone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're going to have to start again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for a long time, I was just worried about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think that ever happened.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanted to make sure--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kept it in a small enough circle</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:19.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I had to completely break something, you know, because I realized the data model was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of fundamentally flawed or something like that, that I felt like I could.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, so yeah, I slowly just kind of opened it up round by round to people who were showing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:34.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">particular interest and mostly to people who I did have some like familiarity with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:39.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">People who I had sort of established connections with in the past, mostly through Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, then right at the end, I just kind of--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think I was really planning to do this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">until close to the end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In fact, I think at one point, I announced</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the up ahead Twitter, I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not going to do a public beta.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just going to push to release this thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so stay tuned.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then at a certain point, I would--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, I guess I just changed my tune.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, all right, I should probably actually just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get some people to exercise this a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">before I press the Launch button.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, opened it up pretty widely in a few waves.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and very glad I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was super helpful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got a lot of good feedback,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">managed to fix a lot of little bugs</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I probably wouldn't have caught otherwise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I do think it created some excitement,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like some buzz, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To sort of have those waves of seats opening up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it definitely seemed like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even during the phase before you opened it up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I mean, I've talked about it on this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I've talked about it with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm a big fan of the big beta test flights</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just in terms of trying to garner some attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">leading up to a launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there was a lot of like buzz in the like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what is this thing or how do I get access?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:43.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And every time you tweet something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people would be very excited</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you know, wanna know what the app was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it is interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do think part of that works because your app is so unique.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, just looking at even a visual picture of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it definitely stands out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, it was an interesting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was interesting to see how that all played out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'm glad to hear that opening it up beforehand</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least bared some fruit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I mean, I think if I'm being honest, too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the other fear I had, again, probably not well-founded,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I think I was just, you know, I saw some of that momentum.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I saw some of that energy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think part of me just worried that, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I just opened up a public beta with 10,000 seats,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">everybody would get it and look at it and go, like, oh, cool,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a countdown app, and then all that energy would kind of dry out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:29.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't-- I'm certainly not convinced that I'm right about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, it could have the total opposite effect, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe that creates a network effect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all these people are talking with other people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about this cool app that they're on the beta of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I know a lot of people have had success</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing betas like that in the past.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think for me, ultimately, I just kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just following my nose a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just like, what do I feel most comfortable with?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for most of development, I just, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I felt more comfortable keeping it small</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just to kind of guard myself a little bit from,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, either breaking things for everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or losing the momentum I had.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So there's a bunch of features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I would love to talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that we definitely don't have time for,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but one thing I do wanna touch on though</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is the whole pattern thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the unlock system that you built around that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did that idea come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or I guess explain what it is first.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the patterns in Up Ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think are probably the most interesting hook</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and ended up being sort of the most interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">differentiator, I guess, in this app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically the way it works is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so when you create an event,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you first open the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can set a name, you set a date,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you set a color, you choose an icon,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you get these nice little sort of bubbly events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on your timeline.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then what can happen,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">usually driven by the content of your event's name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for example, if you type in Charlie's birthday,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then you'll get this pop-up that says,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey, congrats, you unlocked a new pattern</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you'll unlock a birthday pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And basically what that'll be,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't exactly remember what's on the birthday pattern,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's sort of like a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like a wallpaper that you can apply to your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's a few different icons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of randomly arranged and sized.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it just, it adds a bunch of visual interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so that's what patterns are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, you can unlock them in a few different ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I said, often they're triggered</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by the content of your events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or even sometimes the date of your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's actually a whole bunch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of different potential triggers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A lot of which I'm not even really using right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I have lots of ideas</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for how I can use different triggers in the future.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then there's also a whole other set of patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that'll just unlock more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">based on sort of an achievement system, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when you create your first three events,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you unlock a pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I think after that, once you hit 10,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you unlock another pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Once you hit 20, you unlock another pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there's a few other types of achievements as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it basically just continues.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The idea is as you use the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without even really thinking too much about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you should fairly frequently, at least at first,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get these little hits of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, I just unlocked a new pattern, that's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can apply it to that event</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you can use it as much as you want after that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And like you say, without trying too hard,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But one thing just from talking to you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I already know is there are a lot of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who do try very hard and have already treated it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a game to be beaten.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I won't reveal how many patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are in total right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I know, I think the highest I've seen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is somebody told me that they had unlocked 55,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like completely out of control.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this was within a few days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I have no idea how they managed to find all these.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They must've just spent hours.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's not all of them, is that correct?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's not all of them. - Oh, okay, there you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So whoever that person is, there's still more out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Anyways, yeah, so that's a lot of fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so you're spending all this time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">making the ludicrously polished and delightful-to-use app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You have a test flight, you've got a little bit of buzz,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you already have somewhat of a following</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just from your time writing and all that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now we're getting to launch day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was kind of your plan going into that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a couple things else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think one thing I'll say up front is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I started to really burn myself out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on this app at a certain point, pretty late.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I think I did a fairly good job</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of keeping it together for the most part</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over a pretty long development process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it was slow and it can be really hard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I find it can be really hard like psychologically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you really wanna finish something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you just like every day that goes by</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you don't make progress you're really aware of the fact that you didn't make progress that day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's like a really exhausting feeling to have day after day after day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:54.940 --> 01:07:03.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I say that just to say that I think by the time I got I finally got to like OK I can actually launch this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just don't think I had a lot left in the tank to really put serious effort in a way that I hadn't in the past into like launching this thing and marketing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did a few things like we talked about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I opened the beta up pretty widely,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so I started to get some interest there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I opened it up for pre-order as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which was an interesting thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an App Store feature where basically you can,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though the app is free to download,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can allow people to get in there ahead of time and pre-order it so</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that on the day that the app is released,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it'll automatically download to people's phones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So again, that was just a nice way to kind of point people in the direction of the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And kind of the, the like little secret there is you can push updates while after you've already like released the app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which feels like a weird loophole in, in app store connect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:13.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause as far as I know, typically, like if you're just, if you've got a build that's been reviewed and is ready to be released, you can't, you can't like push, you can't sort of fix</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:18.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something without actively and push a new build without actively rejecting that build that's been</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">reviewed. And when you have something up for pre-order, that's not the case. I was able to just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:29.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like start working on new builds, fix little issues, get those reviewed while my 1.0 was still</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">waiting in the like ready to be released state. So that was really handy. But yeah, I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:40.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the other thing that kind of hurt me on launch is, again, I was just I didn't want to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">delay launch because I was just so exhausted by the whole thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:48.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I had launched like right after iOS 16 came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:48.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So from a press point of view, that that was not a good move.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't the same week as iOS 16, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, I think it was the following week.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it meant that like when I would or yeah, it was close to it a week or two after.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it meant that when I was reaching out to press and trying to get some interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on that angle, I think I think those folks were just like, yeah, they were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they were busy dealing with much more important things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All right, so I ended up getting some press coverage,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it was like, it was sort of last minute press coverage</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where they were reacting to the fact that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, there's this app out that people are talking about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so let's quickly write something about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I wasn't really able to kind of set that up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the way that I would have liked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So anyway, yeah, I relied mostly on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thankfully, the app Twitter account itself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">did really well over time, just like gaining followers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like, yeah, there's a good number of people who were specifically invested in when</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this app was going to come out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so, yeah, there was just like a lot of energy around that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I posted on product on that didn't do too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:58.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But again, it's just like all these little avenues that I yeah, people tend to go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I didn't I didn't put too much more effort into it beyond that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So then how how did the launch go?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, it hit expectations.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, basically what I was looking for here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think this was true when I built Obather as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What I was ultimately looking for was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a really solid reason to continue building this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:29.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A way that I could justify to myself that this is going to be,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having spent all this time putting into it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having put all of this time into it up to this point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Can I justify continuing to put time into it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think, oh, bother.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Ultimately, the answer was no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think with up ahead, the answer so far has been yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Launch went really well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've been really excited by how many people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically, how many people have converted,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how many people have downloaded the app and are excited enough about it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to actually purchase a subscription or even purchase</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">make a lifetime purchase, which, by the way, that was like a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a late, late, late, like 1.02.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I had already put up my 1.0 for review</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and somehow finally I convinced myself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I should probably add a lifetime purchase</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because enough people, just through the pre-order,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just from people going to the app store to pre-order</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like scrolling down to read the fine print.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Super hidden thing that Apple does not want anybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to actually look at.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and people were noticing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, this is subscription only and reaching out to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and being like, hey, like, can you add a lifetime option?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And initially I felt uncomfortable about doing that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because basically because of what I was just saying,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is that my approach to releasing this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was I want to see if I can justify continuing to work on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which means that for me, there's a chance that I won't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">For me, there's a chance that this thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe this fizzles out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to try.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to keep working on it for a little while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but maybe, I mean, put it this way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe I won't still be working on this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">three years down the road, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which tends to be the lower limit on like the lifetime purchase multiplier, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like people usually say like, "At least 3x your annual price."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Often people say four or five or six.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I felt uncomfortable about that for a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think ultimately, where I've landed is just sort of a shift of perspective there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is that like, often people...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Lifetime probably isn't the best word for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Unfortunately, that's just the word that people look for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think really what people are paying for there is just like the freedom to not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have to worry about a subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also it gives people the ability to support me more up front, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like financially, that actually helps quite a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If people want to say, you know what, I'm going to I'm going to basically pay for three</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:55.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">years of this app right now, instead of paying for it month by month or year by year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's actually sort of a show of support, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I sort of started to realize a lot of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually want to be able to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So where was I with that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of went on a tangent there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I really like that framing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I feel like you're having</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the exact same feelings I have,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but coming to a different conclusion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I've always been afraid of subscription</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because dark noise is not my full-time job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not what I spend all my time on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm afraid of the idea of having a sort of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is it Damocles, is that what that's called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the thing you know the thing around your neck that like people are paying me monthly for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this or yearly for this I need to be continuing to add value but I don't have that feeling</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">now Dark Noise is just paid up front but like like you said there's an assumption with some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people at least that when you pay up front that this will be supported for at least a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while and I've never really thought about that and especially if you have the subscription</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sitting right there next to it, Lifetime certainly gives an impression that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this will be supported for some time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whereas maybe paid up front, there's a little bit more of that safety net of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, you're paying for what it is now and not necessarily what it'll be in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">future.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:10.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I've never really thought of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I guess the idea was in your head that if you realize that this wasn't going to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">be worth your time or whatever, that you could, you can always turn the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscription piece off and then make it just a paid up front or not paid up front,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but a single price or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, but also people can cancel their subscriptions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's the thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just like hypothetically, if I decide a year and a half in that, like, OK, I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">going to I'm going to wind down support for this app, which again, at this point, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">absolutely don't think that's the case.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like just to reiterate, like launch has gone well and I'm really excited to keep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">building this thing. But, you know, in that situation, while it means that monthly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscribers if they want can just stop right away and annual subscribers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they've only paid for two years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if they're still getting value out of it, then they can just keep using it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:59.560 --> 01:14:59.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sort of.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, that's keeps the ball in the user's court.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I that's, I like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I it's, it's funny hearing you describe it that way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause it's the same insecurities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, but yeah, manifested sort of a different way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">anyway, so yeah, all that to say a lot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess the other thing I wanted to mention on that, which I just found sort of shocking,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">frankly, is just the percentage of people that are actually willing to pay lifetime</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for an app like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's just been a good lesson for me in the very self-evident but not always intuitive</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:50.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">idea that my purchasing behavior is not always representative of people's purchasing behavior.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">For me, just the reality for me is like if somebody on Twitter was hyping up this new</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app for a year and a half that they only worked on in evenings and weekends and they finally</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shipped it and it's a countdown app, like personally I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, let me be careful about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:11.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If it's an independent developer I want to support, for sure I'll go and support them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like just generally speaking, that type of situation is not the type of situation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:20.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where, yeah, I'll spend like $40 and hope that, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I continue to get value out of this app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like at the drop of a hat, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think you hit it though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You just hit it right there, which is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're thinking these random people on Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">why are they supporting me?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then when you reverse it, and you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, you know, I won't give any specific examples,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, like people that you know and respect,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like even, 'cause I've definitely done that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I've bought lifetime versions of people's apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I don't really intend to necessarily use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just really like the work that they do, and I'll probably use it sometimes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:56.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I want them to be successful in this thing and keep going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. And Lifetime is honestly a lot of times better for that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because then it's not a subscription sitting there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like, I should probably cancel that because I don't really use this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's a person I like and I want, you know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, and I think the other thing, too, that is just.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I think is still just true is that I think software like this is severely undervalued,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">generally speaking, right? Like, in a certain way, I don't like, I guess my fear was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:37.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that most people would absolutely balk at like spending $30, 30 US dollars,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which here is like 40 bucks on a countdown app, right? Like that just that my fear was that that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:50.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would sound ridiculous to, you know, 99% of people. But then, yeah, I guess all I'm trying to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">say is, on the other hand, like, I don't think it's ridiculous. Like, I know it's not ridiculous,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I've spent the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours building this thing, right? Like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:04.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's, this stuff takes time. And I think apps, I mean, we all know this, but apps, I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a long time have been severely sort of devalued because of trends and sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">freemium models and trends in you know just like free apps that sell your data to make money and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all that stuff that we don't need to get into but. And just the concept of value for digital goods is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">really complicated to like comprehend yeah because at a certain scale it's not devalued like I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how to describe that, but yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Software is weird, or digital goods of any kind are weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can make a lot of money or a little money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it doesn't equate to the cost to making it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a way that manufacturing pencil erasers has a cost.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know what I mean?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's a weird thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, which is why it's then so frustrating</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you get those inevitable one-star reviews</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are just like, this is a scam.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how could you charge this much money for a countdown app?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, I'm probably making like 70 cents an hour</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the work I've done right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's just the way it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So then how, let's see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So from a press angle,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you mentioned that you did get some press.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did that end up going?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there was a nine to five article.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I got a quick nine to five article.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I think there are a couple other.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The funny thing is, like, personally, I'm just not even that plugged into a lot of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:45.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these. Sort of press outlets, I probably should be more so in order to keep track</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:49.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of these things. But yeah, I think there was a write up on I'm more the thing that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">moved the needle the most in terms of I mean, this isn't press, but in terms of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:03.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of like external, yeah, external people writing about or hyping up the app is there's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:07.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a there's this Twitter account.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The account's name is basic Apple guy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's just got a bunch of followers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:16.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, he's he's actually I don't really know who this person is, but they're Canadian.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:23.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And somehow, you know, this person stumbled across up ahead and was just totally enamored</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:30.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with it and ended up tweeting about it a couple times, ended up writing this really nice,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like really well-written review about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, to take nothing away from sort of the typical press reviews that you sometimes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get with this stuff, like often they're fairly quick, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, a site like 9to5 writes about a lot of stuff and so often it's just a quick</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, "Hey, there's a new app here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Here's what it does."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was like a very sort of loving blog post about actually how Up Ahead works and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and what this person likes about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, and this person has a huge Twitter following.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that really helped move the needle</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and give me sort of a second spike</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of downloads beyond the initial launch day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:05.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's also just nice to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, it's really nice and validating</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to read something like that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to read somebody who's really putting the time into--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And gets it, recognizes the details you put in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and I guess that that's the key too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it's somebody who's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to go way back to the start of our conversation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about the app, where I was saying that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was coming at this app from a specific angle,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like, I don't just want countdowns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on my home screen, I want a more holistic view</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of my timeline of good things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so yeah, it's really cool when somebody seems to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get that and that really resonates with them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:44.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you mentioned that was a sort of a secondary bounce.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:49.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So presumably, you had the typical launch spike.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is a subscription app, so you do have recurring revenue,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but obviously downloads and stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is still gonna have that giant spike.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How have things gone since then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We're what, a couple weeks out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I could look at my upper head</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to see exactly when. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, we're almost three weeks out now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Three weeks out, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so how's it been going since then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, I don't know how into the details</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we wanna get here, but--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I guess how it impacts you moving forward.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You mentioned it's worth working on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you kind of doubled down on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So basically I have been pleasantly surprised</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by the tail, I guess, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like by how frequently people still seem to be discovering</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and ultimately paying for the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's an indication that you've tapped</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into that existing market and not just, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your following slash tech Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's the interesting thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's something that I still don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's certainly the, that's the next step for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like beyond the development work that I have left to do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a lot of stuff I want to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A lot of features I want to add to the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I don't, I'm not convinced yet that I've really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what the right like analogy is here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but although the tail has been long,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not convinced that it is flat yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's still like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not sure that I have actually sort of hit that point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where things are actually going to flatten and maybe start to like go up again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right. Like I don't think I've certainly in terms of like apps or optimization and stuff like I'm not there yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:34.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right. Like there are so many apps you know so many countdown apps that are ranking above me and you know anything you would search for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah. So I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess like I have been heartened.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:40.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. By just how many people still seem to be discovering it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it seems to me like that's still largely either word of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:54.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mouth or just still Twitter bubble fringes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and the really exciting thing for me now is just that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">relatively speaking, I don't have a ton of downloads yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In other words, I know there's a ton of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">untapped potential here, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, and the challenge is just...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The TAM is large.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the TAM is large,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and my slice of that right now is minuscule.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's negligible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm really excited to, like, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there's something there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there's like a piece of that pie</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I can go and grab.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm especially heartened by the fact that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, the people who are finding this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">many of them are actually converting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and are leaving really good reviews</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and are giving me good feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's something here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's excitement here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I just, I need to go and find more eyeballs now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I guess like getting those download numbers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">conversions and good reviews,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of that stuff's presumably gonna help</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your App Store optimization.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Have you gotten any like Apple features yet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or gotten on any lists or anything like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- What's funny is I didn't even realize I had,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in fact, I think at some point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, we were talking and, and you asked me like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, do you have any features?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, no, like weirdly I don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I just like, wasn't looking properly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I don't know, I don't even know what I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I was using one of these tools and I didn't, anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It so happens that yes, the app was on a few of these lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, what do you, do you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do you think those lists do anything at this point?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think certain lists make a huge difference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think certain lists can.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's the trick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think so, and this is me, a very much not expert</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that should not be broadcasting my opinions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to lots of people as if I know what I'm talking about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but here we go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, like for example, for Dark Noise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew it's a similar thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a white noise app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a trillion of them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all with their own different things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some of them do stuff way better than me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some of them are old, whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew it was gonna be hard to compete on pure keywords</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and doing all that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause there's so many of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:07.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if you search the word white noise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a list or a couple,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:12.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on how you do your query and where you're at,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are like relaxing sleep sounds.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a curated list by Apple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had that as like an explicit goal,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I was like, that feels like a cheat code</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to like rank higher.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if I search that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sure, dark noise might not show up at the top,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that list shows, and a lot of people will click on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I presume countdown apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">might have similar things like that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that almost feels like that type of thing's important,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">potentially. - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And then the other one is like new versions of iOS.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you get in on the like great apps for dark mode</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or whatever this is, great apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or whenever the dynamic island support comes in,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">presumably they'll have a list for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if you can get in on that, which of course is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe it's a fool's folly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what the right word is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to spend all your time trying to go for those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause it's like there's 10 apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and through no fault of your own,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you might not get chosen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I've definitely felt the effects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for long periods of time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not just during that week of being in those lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I do think there's a lot of value</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think a lot of that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you build a good app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maintain a strong reputation and good reviews,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think those just kind of come and you can't--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Play the game going for them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or at least I don't know how to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so the way I'm thinking about it right now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">along those lines is just, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my understanding of it is the same as you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, just to complete that last point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, yeah, I agree with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think a lot of those lists can be valuable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the ones that are like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you're, you know, like three swipes in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:53.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on like the new and noteworthy utilities page,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:54.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, like it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are certainly a lot of those sort of automated lists</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I don't think move the needle at all anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, there are definitely some that do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think the hidden thing is the fact that some of those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">will show up in search results.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it can make them have a bigger impact</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than it seems like at first blush.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So yeah, I mean, so I think my goal now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is I'm not gonna worry about that too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the best thing I can do at this point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is keep building, is keep updating the app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:33.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keep it active, keep talking about it, keep trying to organically, you know, have people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">find it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think my sense with those sort of App Store features is, well, like you said, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">think they can sort of come with time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:47.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if you can sort of show, whether you're showing somebody curating something or just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">showing an algorithm that like, the app is active, that you're actively updating it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're continuing to get good reviews, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:55.300 --> 01:29:01.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, you know, I think there's just sort of a certain like profile of these types of apps that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, that Apple wants to sort of surface in those lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:11.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, we use the word Apple often as a entity as if it's a singular thing. But I exactly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think a lot of those, I don't know this at all for like a fact. But my understanding</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:22.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through grapevines is that like, there's there's kind of a, like nomination thing that can happen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:28.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">internally. And I think that's part of why building up that reputation using like Apple's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:35.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">API as well, those types of things will increase the chance that somebody internally will notice</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like your app and nominate it. And if multiple people are nominating it from multiple angles,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe it's more likely. It comes back to sort of the cliche of like, if you build a good thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:53.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you don't automatically get anything, but over time, your odds definitely are higher than if</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're building a sort of crummy thing. So yeah, I mean, so look out for live activity going up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ahead. Dynamic Island, just gonna sit there the entire time counting down to your birthday,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whether you like it or not. In seconds. It's always going to be active in the Dynamic Island.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, that it's like forming into a feature request in my mind now. That would be interesting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right? Is like, because once you get close, it would be kind of fun, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right. I don't know what it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:26.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe it would give you a decent one of the retweets, maybe more important than, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being actually functional. Yeah. Maybe I'll just design it and tweet a screenshot of it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that'll be enough. Okay. So last thing I actually just noticed this the other day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you you tweeted out a I don't want to call it a road map because that's the wrong word, because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:49.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Similar to I think some themes we've talked about here. I'm guessing that as a result of you not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wanting to over commit yourself, you didn't put a timeline or even a specific order on it, but you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:00.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of tweeted out a list of the different ideas that you're sort of mulling over. What was the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what was kind of the thought process behind that? I think so. Part of it is just that I have gotten</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of feedback through a whole bunch of different channels, right? Like email and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter mostly. And a lot of the feedback was very similar, right? Like a lot of feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was touching on a lot of these features that I already kind of knew, like I had in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">back of my mind as like things I wish I could have gotten into V1. And I definitely like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:37.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to get too soon. And so to some extent, this was just a nice way to sort of broadcast to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess not everybody who's giving me feedback, but certainly a good chunk of the people who</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have given me feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:46.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think the people who have given me feedback are often the folks who, you know, are on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Twitter, like following the up ahead account, like I really invested in the app and have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">been for a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:55.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this is a way to sort of let everybody know in one fell swoop that, you know, I hear</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you and here's, you know, I agree with you and here are a bunch of the things I want</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:06.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think the other thing is just I guess I wanted to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm hoping to keep the excitement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the engagement up to some extent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess that's sort of where it comes from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is that I wanna, my goal here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while pacing myself and not completely burning myself out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my goal is to keep sharing what I'm working on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I've been doing this whole time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's very much been,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The whole reason Abba had built the momentum, whatever momentum it did, is because I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very forthcoming about sharing things often on Twitter and stuff. So I just wanted to establish</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:45.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I want to keep doing that. And yeah, and here are some things you can look for. And yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just thought it'd be a good way to kind of pull people in, make them feel like they're,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though we're past launch now, you can still sort of be a part of this. You're sort of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:59.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">welcome into the club. I still want to hear your feedback, right? Yeah. So I guess that was the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the general thinking, honestly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't think too hard about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It just sort of felt like a fun little thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We have definitely gone a decent amount of time here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm glad we had time to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm not gonna let you go</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without asking the question I ask everybody, which is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so what is a person or people out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that have inspired you that you'd recommend others check out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There's a ton, obviously.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is always a tough question,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause there's so many folks, again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like largely through Twitter for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who have really inspired me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's been really interesting to watch a lot of people's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">journeys doing very similar things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the type of stuff I'm trying to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I will, I think one person I'll call out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just because I think it's sort of the independent app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that is closest in spirit, at least design wise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to a lot of the work that I like to do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's Brian Mueller's Carrot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know that's a very popular app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">certainly not a deep cut by any stretch. But the thing that really inspires me about his work and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the thing that I strive to do in my work is the way that balances being a good platform citizen,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:18.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">building apps that feel like iOS apps, while also just like being chock full of personality</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:25.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and interesting UI decisions and color and fun and that's, you know, up ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">definitely strives to do exactly that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a really delicate balance, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Of like, traditionally, I mean, every developer at some point has said,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what if I'm trying to do what Apple would do if they built X, Y, Z?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that can take the form of, you know, it looks like the settings app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is what Apple would really do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you can also like people would describe carrot that way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to certain degrees, if you're looking at the actual features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the support and the system integrations it has, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:00.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it does what you expect it to do as a as a platform citizen while also being completely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">insane in the best way possible. And yeah, that those are the apps that really, at least for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably in part as a, you know, iOS developer, those really like hit home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:21.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, one more one more personal call it quickly is most of his task app. I've just been really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:28.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So he I think that app was launched like not long after Oh, bother.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to say it was like June 2020 or something when he launched that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, it was just like, as far as I understand, it's just a solo effort.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was the beginning out of nothing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so and so, yeah, that's that's the part that is inspiring to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like how how far it seems like he's been able to take that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, my understanding is he's actually got multiple folks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">working with him now on that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that's just like, he's really managed to turn that into a snowball that that has</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:57.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">continued to roll.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a great app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's just I think, again, that's actually another good example of just like great platform</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">citizen but with some, you know, really nice design touches.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:10.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, just been really inspired over this whole time where I've kind of like I've gone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:15.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">up and down on no bother and had a kid and you know, had these times where I was totally</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:19.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not doing anything and then ramped up on up ahead and got it launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's just been like making this thing happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's pretty cool to see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Those are excellent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I very much share those feelings.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I will try to wrap this up so you can go to sleep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I know it's late over there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it's almost late over here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So where can people find you and your work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and your blog that you're about to kick off right away?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:42.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">People should look forward to that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:47.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so I'm on Twitter @danielmgauthier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you don't know how to spell that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I assume it'll be in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The blog is danielgoetzee.me, I believe.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, yeah, those are the two places you can find me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes, it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And the Up Ahead app specifically on Twitter is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:02.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I believe, @theupaheadapp.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Awesome, well, thank you for coming on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This was really fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:12.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, as shown by me maybe taking it too long,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:15.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I've been looking forward to this for a really long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:19.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I like, I've tried, I have a problem with gushing over apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot in this, but this app in particular,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from the first time you sent me one of those screenshots,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people like who followed me for a long time know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I like tweeting out widgets of whatever countdown app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the week I was using.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it hit a very specific thing for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the timeline view just totally clicked with me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a way that I open the app every day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:47.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's not just a widget app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it really is like things I'm looking forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I let things that I shouldn't put in there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:55.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are not positive things sneak in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's actually convenient.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:00.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for the most part, it's just this like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">joyous little bundle of happiness</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I get to open in the morning</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to remind myself of when the next movie</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm looking forward to or video game</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:11.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or event with my kids or whatever is happening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:15.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I cannot recommend the app enough to people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:19.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm so glad that you got it out there and that it's good enough that you're going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to keep it alive because selfishly, I just want this thing to survive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:24.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That means a lot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I'm excited to see what's next.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:32.940</p>
