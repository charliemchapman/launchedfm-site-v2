<p class="time-stamp">00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Launched. I'm Charlie Chapman and today I'm excited to bring you the developer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:25.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">behind the delightful countdown app up ahead. Daniel, go to you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hey, thanks so much for having me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is gonna be a weird one because normally I have people on in a lot of times.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's the first person, the first time I've met them outside of Twitter or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've talked before and also I've been following you through this whole process of making this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very, very excited. So I've been looking forward to recording this episode for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like for a very long time. So I'm excited to get into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna have to make sure I'm not just retelling you all the same stories I've told you before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Give it a bit tricky, but we'll make it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, we'll make it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But before we get into Up Ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's give everybody else a primer on who you are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the three questions I was asking everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is where you from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then we can talk about your career leading up to Up Ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so first of all, I'm from Ottawa,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is in Ontario, which is in Canada.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Grew up here, live here now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's sort of a, it's the capital of Canada,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's sort of a mid-sized city.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so I grew up in Ottawa,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ended up going to school,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of in Southwestern Ontario, near Toronto,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a school called Western in London, Ontario,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then sort of lived in and around Toronto for a little while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but then moved back here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Still have lots of family and friends here and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's right, mate, right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In terms of education, I guess I touched on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at Western I studied, sort of a weird double major</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in both computer science and a degree called Popular Music,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is not, it wasn't sort of your traditional performance</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oriented music degree, it was more about music production</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and music history and sort of cultural impacts of music.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, this really weird sort of split</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">between lots of hard math and computer science stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this really sort of broad degree</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about comparative literature and postmodernism</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">music production and just like...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's quite the contrast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sort of lives at the intersection of computer science and liberal arts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like that's becoming a joke on the show now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's surprising how many people live at those crossroads, it feels like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I mean, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I certainly really appreciated that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that it was the most practical choice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I was never really super...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I put this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't want to say it's not engaged, but not super interested in computer science for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">its own sake.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've always been interested in computers and it seemed like a sensible path to explore,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was also very much into music and very sort of, I really wanted to continue to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">stretch the creative side of my brain so that kind of let me do that in these weird sort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of vague ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so, out of college then, you immediately dove into the lucrative career of music studies</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">me, I assume.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, well, that was the funny thing is, yeah, like, I don't, I have no idea who the other</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people even were, like, in that degree.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think a couple people were actually really into like music production and actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">went on and made a career of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, for me, that was never really going to be a part of where I headed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think probably going into it, I wasn't sure about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think what I was trying to do as like a high school student</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to figure out what I was gonna do with my life</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is I was trying to leave sort of music open as a door, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like maybe there's some way I could, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">leave that door open and somehow combine programming</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with music in some interesting way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or even like I'm sure at the time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still had sort of a notion that, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe I could somehow become a music producer,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever that means.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, but yeah, I mean pretty quickly through school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I realized like that's not,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm interested in that stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but that's not really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's not really where my career is gonna take me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So basically once I finished school,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of had no idea what I was gonna do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I graduated in 2012 and I think partly because of the time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and also maybe just partly because of, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the degree in the school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of came out of that degree with a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a base of computer science but no real practical skills.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I kind of came out not really having any idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how I wanted to apply those skills</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or even like where I could apply those skills.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, you know, sort of through those four years at school,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started to get really interested in the app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the iPhones, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think my first iPhone was an iPhone 4,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which was, I don't know, something like 2011.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I had like an iPod touch before that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was very into, you know, all those early games,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like big doodle jump fan, all that good stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I just like, I started to become really interested in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that development, but had no real, like, through school, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">basically didn't really apply myself in any way to anything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other than school, which like in hindsight probably wasn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the right thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was very focused on school and focused on getting good grades.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just not not not having really applied all that stuff in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">any real way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So all I had to say after school, I basically I had had some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like good part time jobs in school doing kind of like research</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through the school and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I had a bit of money saved up and I basically decided to just take a year to teach myself iOS development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically after school I sat down. I think I literally went to a bookstore and bought a book about how to build for iOS 5 or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you just decided I want to make iPhone apps as kind of a, this is what I want to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Pretty much. It wasn't a job opportunity. It was like, no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, it was just this is something I want to pursue.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have no idea how to do it right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm going to go figure out how to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Why iPhone apps?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, I think there are a couple of things going on there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:18.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One is I think I had this sort of ill defined notion that I wanted to somehow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like get into the startup scene, whatever that meant, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There was there was all this energy, especially on that time around the app store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and around, you know, like people having these little app ideas and then blowing up into these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lucrative businesses and lots of startups popping up all over the place and often mobile was becoming</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a bigger and bigger part of like that startup scene. So yeah, I think part of me, it sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">young Lee and I usually just kind of like wanted to get into that and I don't think I really knew</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what that meant but I knew I had to figure out how to build apps, if I wanted to be involved in any</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that stuff. But I think the other aspect of it too is just like, I think it goes back a little bit to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, my two degrees and like those two sides that I was trying to balance, which is that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">don't think I really wanted to just, you know, shuffle into. I never really know how to put this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I don't want to be, I don't want to like downplay that any interesting work that programmers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who don't build apps are doing, but like I didn't just want to go and be a programmer somewhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was really interested in the creative side of building apps for people who could get them</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into their hands and certainly the design aspect of it too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was really interesting to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The craft of computer science as a thing wasn't as interesting as what computer science could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then create afterwards.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I always tried to think about programming as just a means to an end, I guess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got a tool that I can wield to build cool stuff rather than something that I'm really interested in for its own sake.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I definitely, that's how I feel too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I get that same feeling sometimes where it's like, yeah, you don't want to be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there is an art form and a cool stuff to programming to. It's just for whatever reason,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it doesn't hit the same notes for me in terms of things that you do on your own on the side and get you really excited.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:30.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And interestingly, I think as I've gotten older and navigated this career, I think some of that stuff has become more interesting to me in some ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:41.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think there's so much that I didn't really understand about the craft of programming itself that has become more interesting to me that I have explored deeper in the years since.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, long story short, it's just like apps were really cool to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was really sort of energized and excited by them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I sort of had this weird blank slate opportunity where I was just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">well, I have no idea what I'm going to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this seems like the coolest thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm going to try and do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:02.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you go straight into trying to do something independent?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or did you find a job relatively quickly?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, so I spent a year without a job working on my own projects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I built the first project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm trying to actually think what I tried to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think initially I did the classic beginner thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like to do a true well no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually what I was gonna say is like I went way too big.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had these ideas of just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I honestly don't remember what the app idea was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wish I did, but I had, I remember like sitting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my parents basement this summer after after I graduated from school with like this iOS book</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">open on the desk and like meanwhile I was like trying to learn Ruby on rails because I was I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like just like deep down this rabbit hole of like well I'm gonna need to build a website and I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gonna need to build a back end and I'm gonna need to do this and this and this and I had no idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I was doing and at a certain point thankfully like not too far into it I was like okay I need</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need something simpler like I got to cut it up a little bit here so at that point I started</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">realized, okay, this is going to be more of a learning journey than a, like, I'm going to go</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and build something great and ship it to the world and this is going to be my new job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So what I ended up doing is I, the first app I ever built was an app called SixthNote.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't even know if I can remember why I called it that exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the gist of the app is that it was a journaling app, but the sort of hook was that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You could attach music to your journal entries.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it had an actual music player built into it, such that like if you were listening to music,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you could open up this app and you'd see the music that was playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if you wrote an entry, that music would automatically be linked to your journal entry,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so that if you went and reviewed entries later, you could like hit play on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it would play the music that you were listening to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Listening to on your phone?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How does it know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, it's just like, what was music even called now?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it was just like the iTunes app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you have hooks in you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, okay, I didn't realize that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so there were ways to build sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like third party music players where you could just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, build your own controls to show what was actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so that's how you made your first million then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's all been smooth sailing for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:39.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so like I spent a long time on that app. Just like, so this was, this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was objective C days and it was also just barely post arc days. So when I actually started</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">building this thing, I was actually having to learn specifically about like retained cycles</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and how do these things properly? And so you actually understand all that then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess so. Although again, I was in so deep at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no idea what I was doing on so many different axes that I don't know how much I was really absorbing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And certainly if you go and look at that code, it's just like, why no idea what's happening here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, anyway, so that was just like this interesting project where I was interacting with a whole bunch of different,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:26.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like first-party APIs, because of course then I kept sort of scope creeping this thing where you could also add photos to your entries.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And well, you could also add your location to your entries.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was a great learning app idea, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I was just interacting with so many different things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and having to figure out how to piece all this stuff together.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So anyways, I released this first app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, yeah, nothing happened, of course.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did you have expectations going into it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I probably did have some.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, so just some very naive expectations,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">based on just a total misunderstanding of how this stuff works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And certainly the apps that did work differently at the time, like at that time, if for some reason I had somehow managed to get an app store feature, things would have been very different, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:19.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was not so much the case now. But I had, yeah, I just had no concept of like, you know, what that would take, what it meant to at all, try to market your work, like I just kind of put it out and I crossed my fingers and was like, I hope people find this and of course people can't find it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just not how it works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also, to be clear, the quality also just wasn't there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of course.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was the first thing I'd ever built.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was kind of this weird Frankenstein mishmash</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of strange UI ideas and half baked design and yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, but again, it's just like it was such a great way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to just hone what I was actually trying to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, enough about six note.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I then turned around, so that probably took me something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like six months, and then I turned around and was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now I kind of know what I'm doing. I'm going to make something else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I made a two-player word game that was managed through game center called switchboard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was, yeah, so you took turns basically placing, she had did it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh gosh, this is so long ago now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was sort of boggle-like. So you had a bunch of words on a grid.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:16.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you were trying, oh sorry, a bunch of letters on a grid, and you were trying to pick the letters off of the grid to create a good word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a good, wrong word. And then if you created that word, it was basically like this, you were trying</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to capture areas on the board. So by using letters, those letters would sort of turn your color.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then if the other person used those letters, they would turn back to neutral. So there was this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of like, you know, you were going back and forth trying to create words that would capture the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right areas of the board. Anyway, so that one was like, to this day, I'm still fairly proud of that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">one. I think it's amazing just getting through sixth note and all the mess of that was and figuring</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out what I was doing and then coming out the other end and starting fresh. Yeah, it just made a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">huge difference. I kind of felt like, okay, I actually sort of know what I'm doing. I actually have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some sort of identity that I'm trying to chase with this app. I actually kind of know what I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want it to look like and how it should feel and how everything should fit together. So certainly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you go look at old pictures of that app, it was definitely a pretty blatant, I don't want to say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">rip off because the game was different. But aesthetically, it was very, very similar to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">letterpress. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like that era, I missed this era</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I was in the Android land. But everybody references letterpress. It seemed like everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like was what was the name of this one? By the way, I was gonna add a link in the switchboard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I don't know that you'll find much evidence of it anymore on the internet. But</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and letterpress was uh, shoot. What's his name? The Tweety, uh, Laura,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, or in Victoria.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so that was just, again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was just one of those sort of famous app store stories</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that as a young, upstart dev, you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">okay, well, I can do that, I wanna do that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There must be some way that I can also have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a mega hit on my hands and somehow have millions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of people playing my game.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which, again, of course, I didn't have them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not even close, but yeah, again, like I said,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was a lot more proud of that one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did have some, I did find a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:14.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">attraction just just in the sense of like people who weren't friends and family, I actually saw them playing it a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there were more users than just you know the 10 people I asked to try my app. Yeah, anyway</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was something it was something interesting to me that was like, okay, maybe maybe there's something here</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can continue to do basically after that I decided all right it had been about a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's time to get a job all kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Below through some of this pretty quickly, but basically I did end up trying I continued to have that idea of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want to be in the startup world. I want to join some like high octane startup</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do that whole thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I the first job ever had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What are getting into too much details was just a bit of a mess</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was a lot of young people who had no idea what they were doing. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">spent way too much time working.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the culture was very much just like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">work all day and then work all evening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then if you want work all night</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then continue to work all day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And, and yeah, that was just very much the vibe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for no real reason, you know, in retrospect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just like, but you didn't know any better.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like, okay, well, I guess this is how this is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you know, there were plenty of good people there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I definitely had fun, but yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Things went nowhere there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was at, so I was at this small startup</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for about a year and a half.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From there, I jumped to another little startup in Toronto.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That one was a lot more interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and sort of legit as a little company called Volley.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we basically built,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it sort of stack overflow adjacent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was a way for people to ask questions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and get answers from a community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was more centered around sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the business community, like small businesses</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">start-ups and stuff. And so I was sort of, oh, and I guess one thing I should mention in both of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:08.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these cases is I was the one and only iOS developer. Okay. Which has kind of been a weird theme of my</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">career as I've rarely had the opportunity to sort of join a big team and learn from people who know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what they're doing. Like I came off of a year of just banging my head against books and trying to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">figure out how to build apps. And then I, you know, wandered into these jobs where it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Okay, you're the iOS developer, go and build our app."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just continued to kind of learn by doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and had no idea really what I was doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that can be a good way to learn too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because you can go there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The amount of responsibility that you have,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even if the company ultimately doesn't quite succeed,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is still quite huge and you're having to think about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and deal with, it's the breadth versus depth thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like at a big company, you can go really deep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and learn from people and learn something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, really, really well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But oftentimes at a big company,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're never gonna look at App Store Connect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or you're not gonna learn about, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">build systems or any of that stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause that's not your responsibility.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, when it's all you, it's all you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I worked at Volio.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like a fairly, fairly short stint</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then that company sort of pivoted, I guess in 2015</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's the point at which I came back to Ottawa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, then to sort of wrap up this story</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of how my career has gone, I spent a bit of time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I heard you're sorry, not a bit of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I spent a significant amount of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about three and a half years at a company here in Ottawa</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">called Shubox, which is a really cool company</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that basically builds hearing tests for iPads.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if anybody has ever had their hearing tests</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have gone and visited an audiologist,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">traditionally what you do is you end up in this big</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of sound booth, and it can be this kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:55.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">uncomfortable experience to respond to to cues and get your hearing tested.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was basically this little game you could play on an iPad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You just put on a calibrated set of headphones by this game and it was they were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually like this was a medical company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The degrees were medically valid results that you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">audiologists could use to sort of modernize their practice and make it a lot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">cheaper but also you know we sold to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a lot of industries where maintaining employees</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hearing health is really important legally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so, like construction, military,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of companies and those types of industries</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had a real interest in this type of product</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where they could quickly and easily test employees hearing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, so yeah, there I was finally at sort of more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of a still a small company,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but more of an established company joined an existing team.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, by the end of it was kind of leading</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the iOS side of that company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then yeah, maybe I'll sort of stop there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because at that point, once I left that company,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's when I started to finally get back</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into independently developing apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, is this the point when you decided</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to start your blog, the like going indie blog series?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, pretty much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I left TrueBox in the summer of 2019.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I was just totally burnt out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like just, yeah, again, that was a great company,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">great people, but I was just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was trying to do too much there for tomorrow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I just kind of hit a wall at a certain point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where it's like, I can't keep doing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just kind of quit cold turkey.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had no, nothing lined up having quit that job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I sort of just had this idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I could do some consulting work for a little while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And to be fair, I did have some contacts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I figured I could get some work through pretty quickly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it wasn't a complete dive off the deep end</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by quitting that job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, and then I also kind of recommitted.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still had this whole time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'd had this idea in the back of my head</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would be really nice to actually give</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a building my own apps another go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I kind of like started and stopped through the years,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like through these sort of startup years,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would try to spin out my own projects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I just sort of run out of steam,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">don't have time to commit to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Don't have any idea how to actually,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I built two apps at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like I have no idea how to market these things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really know why I'm doing this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I kind of, yeah, having left that job in 2019,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kind of wanted to recommit a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to get an app out into the world again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And just, and yeah, sort of, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get my name out there a little bit too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">As somebody who could actually build things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as a solo developer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's what, so I mentioned that blog series.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You like wrote a series on, it's amazing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's worth reading now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was going back through reading it again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in prep for this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's one, it's entertaining.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but too it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">anybody who's done this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has obviously everybody has very different experiences,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but a lot of the feelings are the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this series in particular talks a lot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about the feelings of trying to do the whole indie thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did the idea of doing this come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because like this came before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I know it came before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Bob, your first or not your first app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the app coming up, I guess in the story came out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but was it were you working on O bother</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you started the blog series or what was the order there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I guess really the question is why did you do it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, O bother certainly wasn't the first idea I had</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for an app to build in this period of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had actually started down in path of building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is sort of, yeah, they're getting into too much details.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically, a sort of grocery list type of app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had some interesting ideas that I wanted to explore</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just around like sort of building an app around</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what you already have at home,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like building it around what's in your pantry</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and managing that rather than sort of managing recipes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and grocery lists, specifically.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I had actually like pretty seriously started</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">down that road.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think when I started writing the blog posts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that is actually the app I sort of had in mind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I was actively working on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, to answer your question about why I started writing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think like, so one part of it is just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:30.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew I needed an actual way to reach people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I had learned that you can't just not try to reach anybody and then release</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an app and expect it to reach somebody.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started to get more active on Twitter and I think just, yeah, from that lens I figured</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">writing about my experiences, just being honest about what I was doing might sort of draw</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people in a little bit, get people invested in what I was actually trying to build.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, that's just kind of the like, I guess, businessy answer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I've also always loved to write.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, back to school, like a big part of that weird broad pop music literature degree</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was actually writing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, like I did a lot of writing in school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I took a bunch of English courses and writing courses.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:24.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I think a long side, a lot of my big ideas about building my own apps over</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had also often had these big ideas about, you know, like writing for an audience, having</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some sort of blog that had an audience and enjoying that process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it felt like a natural thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It felt like, and it just felt like a way, how do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I get, in some ways it was almost like a bit of a defense</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because the tone of that blog is very much like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if this is gonna work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, I probably think it's not gonna work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but hey, we're gonna give it a shot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think like it actually, yeah, I think to be if I'm being</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">born, I think it was a bit of a defense mechanism, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To just you know what that that tracks so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's part of what drew with draws people like me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to both the blog, but also a lot of the stuff you do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like your humor has that sort of like Chandler from the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">friends like self deprecating defense mechanism thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:33.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, you almost are incapable of being sincere in a way that's very, uh, what's the word</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm looking for? Like, I mean, I'm looking for the word for I am the exact same way. Like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we're jumping ahead a little bit, but even like the way you announced up ahead was, uh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something like, I'm here to save the world with this count that and app or something. And it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's like you're getting out ahead of like, I'm going to say something sincere, but like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know this is a business and please don't hate me for it or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:05.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's really interesting. That's why it's a really, yeah, I have always found that to be a really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tough balancing, I like to be honest. Yeah, it's hard. I mean, it's really hard. So I mean,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hearing you talk about this is a familiar feeling of like, you can, you can look at the world</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:22.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and look at the sort of business plan that you're trying to go with and be like, all right,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know what I need to do to get attention, but then you also don't want to be that guy,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, whatever that guy means in your head. And it's really hard to be sincere</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">draping everything in apologies for being sincere. And so I think taking the like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:48.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">silly goofy approach around it lets you do that without it being annoying in the same way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is interesting because I feel like I'm just on the annoying side usually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:52.760 --> 00:28:02.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right just qualify everything too much. Right. Yeah, that's yeah. I think that's a pretty solid analysis of my entire Twitter brand</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:10.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So okay, so before we get into before we get into Obama itself then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did it work like do you feel like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Writing the way that you were was worth it. Yeah, absolutely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:29.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for genuinely a couple reasons, it did work in the sort of cynical sense that like it did it did garner some attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Specifically, I wrote one post at some point about imposter syndrome</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:41.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which I don't think is really even the right term for what I was writing about. Yeah, but if you want SEO</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was basically writing about, to some extent,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm writing about exactly what we're talking about right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That post was very much about the extremely uncomfortable feeling</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of trying to put yourself out there on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and trying to get people's attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as somebody who's not typically an attention seeker.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, yeah, that did garner some interest.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, cynically sure, I gained some followers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through doing that, but genuinely,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I also actually really enjoyed that process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wrote quite a bit for a while there over this band of about a year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All those posts had like these very silly drawings in them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I cannot say enough like anybody listening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You should seriously just, I'll have a link in the show notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They're worth reading.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They're entertaining and if you're anything like me at least,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's nice to see somebody else feeling the same way that you feel about these things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, well thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, so they were just a lot of fun to write.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And to this day, I still, I lament the fact</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I haven't written now in about two years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That was gonna be my biting follow-up question.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is then why have you not done it going forward?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And the answer is literally just time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really want to have been writing this whole time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I am currently thinking about this jumping way ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I think I'm gonna try to write something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about the up-ahead process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think there's a lot of interesting stuff to write about there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But basically the last post in that little blog series</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was it was me writing just like very broadly about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess about 2020.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, almost all of this took place in 2022.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - 2022 as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Can't say 2022.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So yeah, the last thing I wrote was basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I just had a baby and like I don't have time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do anything anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, hopefully I can get back to it at some point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And as of now, I have not gotten back to it yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'll not, I'll caps, but exclamation point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't be crisis.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's the title.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so that's when I ended up going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and getting a real job again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so OK, so rewinding a little bit then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through this process of writing these,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you sounds like pivoted and started up a new app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which eventually became "O bother."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So what's the sort of story there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so the story that is very much a pandemic story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So basically I was, so the timing here again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I started working on this weird sort of grocery app idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">late 2019, worked on it for a couple months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I was doing a lot of consulting work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this time too, so it certainly wasn't like a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it wasn't getting a ton of time and attention,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was chipping away, you know, this new app idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then March 2020 happened, which meant that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my wife was working from home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it was no longer just me alone at home every day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing my work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And we found that we were stepping on each other's toes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot, not realizing the other person was on a call,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm making a bunch of noise in the kitchen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or just going and talking to somebody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right in the middle of when they're really deep in work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or trying to finish a thought or whatever it might be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I guess this sort of strange little idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just struck me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And pretty quickly, well, actually,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe first I should talk about what the idea was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Basically, what Obama was was a really simple way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to let people know the idea was specifically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your housemates, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So your spouse or your roommates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or whoever you're living with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let people know when you're vulnerable</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and when you're not vulnerable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think pretty quickly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just, I real, once that idea struck me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I sort of realized that this other app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had been shipping away at was going to take a long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just is one of those app ideas that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, I could have continued on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it probably would have taken a year plus</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or maybe get to any sort of finish line</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I would be happy with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's like a mature space,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so there's so many features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that people consider baseline and yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, when this little idea hit me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just, I pretty quickly decided,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know what, I'm just gonna try to build this thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in like a month,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I was just, I was getting a little bit impatient,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think. I just wanted to get something out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I was trying to build a bit of momentum</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the blog and try to, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just get people interested in what I was building.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't want to drag that out for 18 months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I decided to just try to build this little thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I basically tried to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I tried pretty hard to timebox it till like a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I really just poured effort into it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and tried to get it at the door in a month.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I actually managed to do it in about a month and a half,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which in retrospect makes no sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't know how I did that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">especially coming off of up ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which took me like a year and a half.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, this is pretty baby.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was pretty baby and I didn't have a full time job</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the time, so I was much more able to just kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, put my head down and focus for big chunks of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, bother with just this fun little project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I will say I didn't have any grand illusions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with that one at all of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It catching on in any real way or making me any sort of real money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was very much like a, let's just get something out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's like exercise those muscles again of like actually following something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through and getting it at the door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and again, hopefully, you know, get, get some interest,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get people interested in what I was doing and like who I was as an independent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developer, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sort of what my, my sort of style was in building apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and I do think it, it largely succeeded at that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was really happy with the response I got from that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like, I mean, it's still in the store, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I still have it on my phone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes, yeah, it's still there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I definitely feel like it established a very unique,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:46.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, your unique, sort of, visual style and playfulness.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because it was one of those apps where, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my wife was a teacher.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It didn't necessarily, wasn't a required or useful thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for me for how I lived my life.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I just loved playing with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that was the thing about it that really stood out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And especially with the crowd of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who are reading your blog and our other iOS developers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was just a very inspiring piece of work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I almost called it a piece of art,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which I guess is the thing I was meaning for,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it sounds too high for a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it really is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It like you could feel the craft and personality</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a way that really, really stood out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, well thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that was absolutely the intention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like, can I just narrow scope</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the end of the gree, just like build this tiny thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but really, really polished the heck out of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to just sort of show myself and other people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of what I'm capable of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that particular aspect of a building out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is really like the stuff I love, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The stuff I care about and the stuff that I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've continued to kind of hone over time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So did you treat this one?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you talked about, you'd started the blog in part</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the idea of I need to build a little bit of a following</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and use this as a way to market something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did you try to market this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Did you talk to the press, try to push it out there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Short answer is no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thing the short answer is I basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">relied entirely on Twitter, which at the time wasn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot, or like I didn't really have much of a following.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, no, I didn't really think about that too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in fact, I think I wrote a blog post</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that basically just like stepped through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of the weird things that happened</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">after I launched it, that I could have handled</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so much better if I had like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">known what I was actually doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, I'm not sure how much any of the stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would have necessarily moved the needle on anything,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but for example, you know, somebody reached out to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">midday, like, "Oh, bother" was actually on launch day, it gained quite a bit of traction.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It sort of went quote unquote viral in the sort of small bubble that we that we operate</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in. And yeah, someone messaged me at something. I was like, "Hey, I just put your, I just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">put a bother on product hunt." And it's like, I think it ended up like at the top of product</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hunt that day. And like, I didn't even do that. I didn't craft that page at all. I didn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get the chance to write it or like put my own screenshots in there or anything. It was just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">somebody who threw it up and then I kind of scrambled to, you know, try to respond to questions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on there and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Similar thing happened with like all the Apple subreddit, Sunday stuff where like I really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">dragged my feet on that and then it took hours for it to get through the mods and then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it did get through but it was like the end of Sunday at that point and like I, yeah timing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is, well, everything with that subreddit is, it feels like luck.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:56.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, like, yeah, getting it early, getting lucky that for some reason it doesn't get taken down. Yeah, but it I will say that that one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There is a potential upshot. That's pretty high. Yeah for sure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I mean that I got a little bit of traction there, but again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just served in really like control that properly at some point like I wrote about the process of building this thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it ended up quite highly ranked on Hacker News at one point, but like I didn't even have a hacker news account</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then like I started to try to answer questions on Hacker News and then I got rate limited like immediately</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They were just like you're you're posting too many comments</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I couldn't like answer any more questions like it. It was just all this stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just sort of a comedy of errors in me trying to react to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What had happened instead of having any</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Co-gen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I mean the learning experience, I guess I kind of yeah</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I learned what not to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:50.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to some extent, but again, it also wasn't really my motivation wasn't really to have a bunch of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have this sort of breakout and have a bunch of people succeed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:00.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Honestly, I never really had, and I think I was right about this. I never really thought that it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:10.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was an app that had legs as anything more than what you mentioned, right? As something that is playful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and fun to play with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, oh, this is really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like a fun idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was topical, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because the pandemic had just started.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's part of the novelty.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it had some legs initially.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I just, aside from, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are definitely some people who I think still use it today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, it's not the type of app that's really sticky</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for most people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would be hard to build a business off of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The last thing with Obama then is you got that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like Apple themselves tweeted about it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is the hilarious story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll tell it here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is sort of another example of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just reacting to things happening</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and not having any idea what's going on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, initially I did get sort of the standard,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like generated email from Apple that's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we may feature your app in the App Store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so send us your assets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then I'm like scrambling to download Photoshop</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because apparently they only accept Photoshop files</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I have no idea how Photoshop works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I did all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know that any of that was ever actually used.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then a few days later, my dad texts me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and he forwards me in email and he's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got this weird email about your app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really know what it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's just like this completely sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">unofficial looking email,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">addressed to my dad, like with his first name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, hello.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's a different first name than yours.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we're, I don't remember what the exact wording was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's like we're gonna feature, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your app, O'Bother on Apple's social media accounts.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So send us a demo video that you'd like us to use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was just like, no official looking anything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatsoever, it's just like some person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the some person had an Apple address</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I looked them up on LinkedIn and managed to find them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was some sort of person who seemed to actually work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at Apple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I couldn't really figure out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it just, it looked like total spam,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I couldn't really figure out how anyone would benefit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from me sending them a 30 second demo of my app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I was just like, all right, well, first of all,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know why you sent this to my dad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how you know my dad's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if like that to this day, that makes no sense to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like no sense to me at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, I ended up sending them this video</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then sharing off the next day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, from the App Store,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like the official Apple App Store Twitter account</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tweeted specifically about Obama there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think it got posted on Facebook as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which was really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That account has millions of followers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's a pretty neat thing to have happen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's like ignoring whatever results</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that might have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of a validating feeling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Did now, did it have any impact on sales?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nope.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:09.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Really?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like really not.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Really not at all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was shocked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That is very, that actually is really surprising to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now that was a paid up front app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- No, a bother was free.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It was free.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It just basically had a little like plus tier inside</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a tip jar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Wow, that legitimately surprises me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it was really strange.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You'd really think that that's hitting a lot of eyeballs and a lot of people are going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to click through.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I get that it's not, you know, it's not like a traditional marketing channel, like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how many people are really following it and what level of intent would they have.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:55.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But still, like just the size of the net and what I assume being in a small indie app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">project, it's not like you had this massive, you know, user base.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you'd notice a decent bump.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And yeah, I mean, there was certainly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there was some sort of bump,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, it's just like really, really not at all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I would have expected.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's like interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's probably a difference of like maybe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a thousand, a couple thousand downloads maybe,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and certainly not translating into much</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of in-app purchases.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So yeah, very, very cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, maybe you're not like this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but the couple features in that vein</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I've gotten before, although I've never had that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's the type of thing that you're family</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that isn't technical.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It kind of feels like, no, no, for real.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Look, you can go to their official page</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it has the thing that I made.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I actually do real things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so, oh, bother, definitely a success story,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would say for sure from your perspective,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there was obviously there was a lull.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We've mentioned that you had a baby</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this point in between, but like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">did you come off a Vobotter saying like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all right, I'm gonna start my next thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or where you kinda like, I'm taking a break.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I was back and forth on this a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I certainly wanted to do more with Vobotter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than I ended up doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had plans to continue to chip away</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at that app for a little while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Add some additional features to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the specific thing that I actually got</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">really close to finishing building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's, I'm sad it never got at the door,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I wanted to build some calendar integration</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so that you could hook up the start of the day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You could just sort of like import when your meetings were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it would automatically flip you from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on-bought or bolder-bought or bolder-able</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">throughout the day based on your calendar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I had some ideas like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I wanted to continue working on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm trying to think about what the timeline was here again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I guess I think a scholarship somewhere</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of like summer like early summer 2020 and yeah I became a dad in September of 2020.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there wasn't really a lot of time there before everything just kind of changed for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah. My time kind of went out the window.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah I think at a certain point I don't know exactly when but I just kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">resigned myself to the fact that you know what I think. Oh, well there's kind of find the way it is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:30.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's probably not something with my more limited time now, it's probably not something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:38.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">worth continuing to work on. Again, because I had, unlike when I actually built a bother in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:46.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">around September of 2020, I got back into full-time work. So that plus a kid was just sort of a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">complete change to my ability to actually do any work on that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:55.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's fast forward. So you, at that point, you know, you get back into full time work and you're,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're doing that happily getting no sleep at all. But you have a little button to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:08.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">enjoy with you. So we fast forward, I guess, a couple years and then how does up ahead or some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:14.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of project end up coming into being? Were you looking for a project again? Or like, what's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:19.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the origin story here? What is the origin story about the head? I think, I think I was, I was in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in search of a new project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that's probably the best way to put it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I said, I kind of decided</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that a bother probably was not sort of the thing to get to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't the thing for me to try to take the next step.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whatever, like ambiguous next step that is just like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of trying to get more users,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to build something better,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">trying to become a better independent app developer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, bother probably wasn't gonna be the thing to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, at a certain time, at a certain point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">once life calmed down a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess it was sort of summer 2021.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think I was pretty much just searching for a project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So much that I think at a certain point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I actually remember sitting down and just working on not an app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like an app that didn't actually do anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just sort of like playing with UI</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just sort of like building different sort of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, like imagining different ways</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I could like style an app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like sort of different like directions I could go in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for like how to design, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever I wanted to design next</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without actually having any idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what it was I wanted to build.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But meanwhile, I guess the very simple origin story</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of Up Ahead is just that I have always enjoyed counting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">down to things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just find it's a fun way to give the future a bit of definition,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a bit of color to be like, oh yeah, in three days,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've got this random thing that I'm looking forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whether it's a birthday or something as simple as just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a hockey game I'm looking forward to watching or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that would often just--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would often just have notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I usually use bare for note taking,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but just like some note app where I would just like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">write down things with dates on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like I'm just imagining you have a note.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's just a number in every day you'd wake up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and update all your notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, no, it wasn't that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just a playing list of events and dates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was looking forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, and I think like throughout the year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'd often gone to the App Store and looked for apps that would count down to things and just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:25.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know. I guess classic story. I've just I was never really satisfied with anything that was out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:31.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an extremely busy space. Yeah, yeah, extremely noisy space on the App Store, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's just so much there there are so many of them that are full of ads</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There are a lot of them that are really focused on widgets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But sort of the actual in-app experience is a little bit cumbersome and just like not really interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, yeah, a lot of them are just really old and not really maintained anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:55.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So anyways, I just never really found anything that tickled me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you had a certain point of just like, well, this might be a good, I guess the other</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing to mention is I was certainly looking for another fairly narrowly scoped.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This certainly took me way longer than I thought it would, but I'm not so certainly glad</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it was as relatively narrow on scope as it was because it took me a year and a half</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to get out what is like at the end of the day in some ways a pretty simple countdown app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I'm not building some huge complicated product here. But like given your sort of style,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keeping the scope narrow allows you to spend the obnoxious amount of time on the polish.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because that's like with all of your stuff, it's like that's what really makes it shine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's not the amount of features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's how well they're done.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and so yeah, I think I just sort of thought</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a countdown app was a good vehicle for that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like a slightly larger in scope than a bother.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Also probably quite a bit more useful,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it felt more like the kind of app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that actually might have legs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean the existence of a market kind of proves that out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so obviously the challenge there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is actually getting noticed,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which we can get into here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I felt like a good vehicle for that next step</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to allow me to really polish things up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">explore some interesting ideas around a pretty simple core.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So did you have an initial hook?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I can already see the description of bear</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being a list of your events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then what sort of the main skeleton of Up Ahead is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was that kind of the initial idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of what differentiated it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, the first thing that sort of peaked my interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in thinking through this and thinking through what it could be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and what could make it interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was sort of that main timeline view.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At least all countdown apps I've ever seen,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the sort of in-app experiences really just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here's a list of all the events you've created</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you can then, you know, spin widgets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out of or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for me, I guess, I think part of the reason</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:16.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I used my silly note instead of putting widgets on my home screen is because I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:23.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I actually liked was not just knowing that there are X days until this event I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:30.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">looking forward to, but being able to look at the future more holistically, like look at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:36.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the next up ahead, you might say, yeah, look up ahead at the next three weeks and be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh man, there's like six things that I'm looking forward to in the next three weeks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And here's how they all fit in together, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know these are like back to back to back.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's going to be an awesome three days."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That quickly became, I think, the sort of first differentiator for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The first thing that I was trying to do is that timeline view that you see in Up Ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">now that actually shows you visually sort of how many days are passing between events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and gives you this really sort of attractive way to actually scroll through your future</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">events and also scroll through your past events too, you know, to sort of look</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">back on some of the fun things you'd done over the past month or whatever it might be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:17.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, you sort of just glossed over it, but the gap between the events being different,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on the realistic gap. Where did that idea come from? I think the very first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:26.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">screenshot I ever saw when you were working on this had that in there, and it was kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:33.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like a, oh, like mind blowing kind of feeling it's a simple concept, but yeah, I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, I think I was just playing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So here's what I will say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can remember playing with a few different UI ideas</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:47.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that weren't that before settling on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But we're sort of versions of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can remember trying to mess around with like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what was I trying to do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was trying to like draw lines.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the events were stacked vertically,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I was trying to like just draw lines between them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if they were, if they were further apart,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:06.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was drawing like loopy lines, like having them sort of loop around to sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how messages does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I was, yeah, I was thinking about that a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:17.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But no, to be honest, I don't really know exactly where that idea came from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">At some point, it probably just occurred to me, oh, it would be cool if like there was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:25.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually, if this wasn't just a normal list, if you could actually, if there was some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">visual interest in here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:32.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was tricky to get right at first because initially I just sort of naively tried to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know do something where it's like okay. Well</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So if you look at the gaps between events and up ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's like these little segment these line segments. They're kind of like dashed lines, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:47.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, okay, well, I guess maybe I could have each dash be worth a day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:53.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then immediately you're like, okay, well that's gonna be a terrible experience because like if I if the first event</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I am put as like a birthday that's coming up in 200 days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's kind of a silly scrolling experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:08.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I had to kind of hone that or yeah, figure that out, figure out how to balance</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:12.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that, where you have that visual separation, but it doesn't create just this sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like silly annoying experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you have the idea of a countdown app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:29.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">new long kind of a general design. And then you said you spent a year on this. What was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean that initial thing seemed like that happened pretty quick. This is me bringing some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">insider information in here. But the year was a pretty long process of continual advancement.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:45.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What's kind of like walk through a little bit how that went? What was it that took so long?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:52.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If only I knew that that sounded more tacky than I meant it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What, indeed?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh my gosh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's honestly as painful to look back at, I don't think it's my pinch tweet anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I probably changed it when we launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for a long time, my initial sort of announcement tweet of like, it's the thing you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mentioned earlier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to save the world by building a countdown app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you look at the screenshot attached to that, it looks really similar to what up ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ended up being.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:27.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so on the surface, it's really painful to look at that and go, I got to basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:36.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the entire timeline, that whole thing was built, at least on a surface level in two weeks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was very excited and I was like, "Look at all this progress I'm making."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is going to be another "O bother."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to have this thing out in two months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Why did it take so long?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:51.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, just time, full time job, evenings and weekends, kid.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's just not a lot of time to do this stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There were large stretches of time where I just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wasn't making that much progress.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause it's hard to balance all the things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you wanna do in life.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, more concretely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I certainly wrangling dates is difficult.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:10.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That takes time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So I hear.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so it's one thing to stand up a UI</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the extent that you can take a screenshot of it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and post it to Twitter and get some likes on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's another thing to actually make sure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all of those weird edge cases are working properly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and handling recurring events and how are you handling</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">multi-day events and what if an event has a time set</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and one of it doesn't, what if the start date</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has a time set for some reason the end date doesn't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what if an event doesn't have an end date and like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how do you actually order your timeline</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in such a way that that always sort of feels organic</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and makes sense?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which if that's something, if you've used up ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you haven't thought about that too much,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then hopefully I've done my job right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause that's sort of the goal, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I should all completely.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, that's not a trivial thing to get, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then I think the other thing is to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like honestly, we talked about Obama earlier</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and how it was kind of this cute little app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was very polished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">On the other hand, I do look at that app now</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and there are a lot of parts of that app that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:23.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to my eyes, weren't particularly polished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I do think like I,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:29.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I took a big extra step with up ahead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where with O'Bother, there were parts of it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I was just like, okay, this is good enough.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Gonna move on, I'm trying to timebox this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and trying to get it at the door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think with Abahed, I really just tried really hard</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to never do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really tried hard with Abahed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Every sort of new feature I built,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:50.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every new screen I built, I was really trying to kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">start from, I don't know, from first principles,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess if I can say that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And figure out like how do I make this particular thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:58.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">interesting?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I make it actually fun, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I tell people how to use widgets?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And actually we're making it go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If anybody listening has not looked at the widget settings</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for up ahead, it is ridiculous in the best way possible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so yeah, I think it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the reason I took time is 'cause every individual</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">piece took time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like, I was spending a long time thinking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:29.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through every screen, how do I want my settings to work?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I want the filtering to work?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do I iterate a lot on event creation, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:42.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like how do I make sure that creating events feels quick and easy and fun without, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">also powerful enough to not feel, you know, like there's still, there's still, you still</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:49.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want to give people control there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like they're still controlling what icon they want to use and have some pretty like meaningful</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">controls around dates and the patterns and so there's a, yeah, I certainly hit a read down</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that a lot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, short answer is I just think every piece of that just took time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Every time I thought, "Oh, this'll be an easy screen, this'll be something I can just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bang it quickly."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was never true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I always ended up pushing myself to do something a little bit different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was your test flight beta strategy for this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:23.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you seeding it out to a lot of people early on or small group of people?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The test flight stayed pretty small until the very, very end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just very slowly brought more people in as I went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I just worried about a couple things with the test flight that probably weren't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">particularly well founded.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I was very cautious not to bring too many people in too quickly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One because I just didn't want to accidentally break a bunch of people's apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:56.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really wanted to make sure that when a lot of people had their hands on a beta, I wanted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to make sure I was confident that I could transition them onto the real app and not break</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">their data.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:02.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You know, accidentally be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, oops, all your data's gone,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"you're gonna have to start again."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So for a long time, I was just worried about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think that ever happened.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I wanted to make sure it was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I kept it in a small enough circle</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that if I had to completely break something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I realized the data model</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was sort of fundamentally flawed or something like that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I felt like I could.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, so yeah, I slowly just kind of opened it up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">round by round to people who were showing particular interest.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:34.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And mostly to people who I did have some, like familiarity with,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people who I had sort of established connections with in the past, mostly through Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:46.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, then right at the end, I just kind of, I don't think I was really planning to do this until</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">close to the end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In fact, I think at one point I announced on the other head Twitter, I was like, I'm not going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to do a public beta, like I'm just going to push to release this thing, so stay tuned.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then at a certain point, I would, yeah, I guess I just changed my tune and I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all right, I should probably actually just get some people to exercise this a little</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bit before I press the launch button.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:10.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, open it up pretty widely in a few waves and very glad I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was super helpful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I got a lot of good feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Managed to fix a lot of little bugs that I probably wouldn't have caught otherwise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I do think it created some excitement, like some buzz, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So to have those waves of seats opening up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it definitely seemed like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">during the phase before you opened it up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I mean, I've talked about it on this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I've talked about it with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm a big fan of the big beta test flights</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just in terms of trying to garner some attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">leading up to a launch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There was a lot of buzz in the like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what is this thing or how do I get access?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And every time you tweet something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people would be very excited.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you know, wanna know what the app was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it is interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I do think part of that works because your app is so unique.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, just looking at even a visual picture of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it definitely stands out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, it was interesting to see how that all played out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm glad to hear that opening it up beforehand,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at least, paired some fruit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and I think the other,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I'm being honest to you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the other fear I had, again, probably,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably not well-founded.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think I was just, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I saw some of that momentum.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I saw some of that energy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think part of me just worried that like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just opened up a public beta with 10,000 seats.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Everybody would get it and look at it and go,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, cool, it can't happen."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Then all that energy would dry out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But that's it, but I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm certainly not convinced that I'm right about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, it could have the total opposite effect, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe that creates a network effect,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all these people are talking with other people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about this cool app that they're on the beta of.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I know a lot of people have had success</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing beta's like that in the past.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think for me, ultimately, I just kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was just following my nose a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just like, what do I feel most comfortable with?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for most of development, I felt more comfortable</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keeping it small, just to kind of guard myself a little bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from, yeah, either breaking things for everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or losing the moment to my head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So there's a bunch of features that I would love to talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that we definitely don't have time for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But one thing I do wanna touch on though,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is the whole pattern thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the unlock system that you built around that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did that idea come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All right, I guess explain what it is first.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the patterns in up ahead,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think are probably the most interesting hook</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and ended up being sort of the most interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">differentiator, I guess, in this app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Basically the way it works is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:41.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so when you create an event, when you first opened the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you set a name, you set a date, you set a color,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you choose an icon, you get these nice little sort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:53.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bubbly events on your timeline. But then what can happen, usually driven by the content</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:59.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of your events name. So for example, if you type in Charlie's birthday, then you'll get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this pop up that says, "Hey, congrats, you unlocked a new pattern." And you'll unlock a birthday</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pattern. And basically what that'll be, I don't exactly remember what's on the birthday</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pattern, but it's sort of like a wallpaper that you can apply to your events. So it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a few different icons sort of randomly arranged and sized.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it just, it adds a bunch of visual interest to your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so that's what patterns are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, you can unlock them in a few different ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I said, often they're triggered by the content</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of your events or even sometimes the date of your events.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's actually a whole bunch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of different potential triggers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of which I'm not even really using right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I have lots of ideas for how I can use different triggers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the future.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then there's also a whole other set of patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that'll just unlock more based on sort of an achievement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">system, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when you create your first three events,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you unlock a pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I think after that, once you hit 10,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you unlock another pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Once you hit 20, you unlock another pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there's a few other types of achievements as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it basically just continues the ideas</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as you use the app without even really thinking too much about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You should fairly frequently, at least at first,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get these little hits of like, oh, I just unlocked a new pattern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:12.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can apply it to that event</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you can use it as much as you want after that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And like you say without trying too hard,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but one thing just from talking to you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I already know is there are a lot of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who do try very hard and have already treated it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a game to be beaten.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I won't reveal how many patterns</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there are in total right now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I know I think the highest I've seen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is somebody told me that they had unlocked 55,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like completely out of control.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And this was within a few days.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I have no idea how they managed to find all these.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They must have just spent hours.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's not all of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that correct?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's not all of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So whoever that person is, there's still more out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:54.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's a lot of fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so you're spending all this time making,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the Ludicryssley polished and delightful to use app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You have a test flight, you've got a little bit of buzz.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You already have somewhat of a following just from,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, your time writing and all that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now we're getting to launch day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was kind of your plan going into that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There's a couple things else.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I think one thing I'll say upfront is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think I started to really burn myself out on this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at a certain point, pretty late.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I think I did a fairly good job of keeping it together</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for the most part over a pretty long development process.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it was slow and it can be really hard</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:48.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I find it can be really hard psychologically when you really want to finish something and you just like every day that goes by and you don't make progress</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:54.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're really aware of the fact that you didn't make progress that day. That's like a really exhausting feeling to have day after day after day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:03.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I say that just to say that I think by the time I got I finally got to like okay, I can actually launch this thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just don't think I had a lot left in the tank to really put serious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:13.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this effort in a way that I hadn't in the past</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">into launching this thing and marketing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did a few things, like we talked about,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I opened the beta pretty widely,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so started to get some interest there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I opened it up for pre-order as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which was kind of an interesting thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an App Store feature where basically,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though the app is free to download,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can allow people to get in there at a time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pre-order it so that on the day that the app is released,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it'll automatically download to people's phones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So again, that was just a nice way to kind of point people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the direction of the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And kind of the little secret there is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:56.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can push updates while after you've already</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like released the app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, which feels like a weird loophole</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in App Store Connect, 'cause as far as I know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">typically, if you've got a build,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's been reviewed and is ready to be released,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can't like push, you can't sort of fix something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without actively and push a new build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without actively rejecting that build that's been reviewed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And when you have something out for preorder,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's not the case.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was able to just like start working on new builds,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">fix little issues, get those reviewed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while my 1.0 was still waiting in the like ready</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to be released state.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was really handy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I mean, I think the other thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that kind of hurt me on launches.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Again, I didn't want to delay launch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I was just so exhausted by the whole thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I had launched like right after iOS 16 came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so from a press point of view,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that was not a good move.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It wasn't the same week as iOS 16, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, I think it was the following week,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it meant that like when I would,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or yeah, it was close to it, a week or two after.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it meant that when I was reaching out to press</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and trying to get some interest on that angle,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think folks were just like, yeah, they were busy dealing with much more important things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I ended up getting some press coverage, but it was sort of last minute press coverage</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where they were reacting to the fact that, oh, there's this app out that people are talking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about, so let's quickly write something about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I wasn't really able to kind of set that up in the way that I would have liked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So anyway, yeah, I relied mostly on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that thankfully the app, the app Twitter account itself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">did really well over time, just gaining followers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, yeah, there's a good number of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who were specifically invested in when this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was gonna come out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so, yeah, there was just like a lot of energy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">around that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I posted on product on, that didn't do too much,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but again, it's just like, all these little avenues</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I, yeah, people tend to go,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, I didn't put too much more effort into it beyond that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So then how did the launch go?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I mean, it hit expectations.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I was basically what I was looking for here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think this was kind of true</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I built a bother as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What I was ultimately looking for</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was a really solid reason to continue building this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A way that I could justify to myself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that this is gonna be, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all that having spent all this time putting into it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having put all of this time into it up to this point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">can I justify continuing to put time into it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think, oh, bother, ultimately the answer was no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think with Up Ahead, the answer so far has been yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Launch went really well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've been really excited by how many people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">basically how many people have converted,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how many people have downloaded the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and are excited enough about it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to actually purchase a subscription,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or even purchase, it'll make a lifetime purchase,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which by the way, that was a late, late, late,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like 1.02, like I had already put up my 1.0 for review,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and somehow finally, I convinced myself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I should probably add a lifetime purchase,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because enough people just through the pre-order,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just from people going to the App Store to pre-order,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and scrolling down through the front,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">super hidden thing that Apple does not want anybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually look at it. Yeah. And people were noticing, oh, this is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscription only and reaching out to me and being like, Hey,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, can you out of lifetime option? And initially I felt</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">uncomfortable about doing that because basically because of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what I was just saying, which is that my, my approach to releasing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this app was, I want to see if I can justify continuing to work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on it, which means that for me, there's a chance that I won't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right there for me is a chance that this thing, maybe this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">fizzles out I'm going to try, I'm going to keep working out of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a little while, but maybe, I mean, put it this way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe it won't, maybe I won't still be working</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on this have three years down the road, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which tends to be the lower limit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on like the lifetime purchase multiplier, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like people usually say like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"I get used three acts, your annual price."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Often people say four or five or six.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I felt uncomfortable about that for a while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I think ultimately where I've landed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is just sort of a shift of perspective there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is that like often people,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:26.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think lifetime probably isn't the best word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Unfortunately, that's just the word</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that people look for,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I think really what people are paying for there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is just like the freedom to not have to worry</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about a subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also it gives people the ability</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to support me more upfront, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like financially, that actually helps quite a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If people wanna say, you know what?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna basically pay for three years</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:56.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this app right now instead of paying for it month by month or year by year. That's actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of a show of support, right? That I sort of started to realize a lot of people actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">want, want to be able to do. So where was I with that? I kind of went on a tangent there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I really like that framing because I feel like you're having the exact same feelings</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have, but coming to a different conclusion because I've always been afraid of subscription</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because dark noise is not my full-time job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not what I spend all my time on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm afraid of the idea of having a sort of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's a damn-a-clease, is that what that's called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The thing around your neck that people are paying me monthly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for this are yearly for this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I need to be continuing to add value.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't have that feeling,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">no, dark noise is just paid up front.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like you said, there's an assumption with some people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that when you pay upfront that this will be supported for at least a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I've never really thought about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And especially if you have the subscription sitting right there next to it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">lifetime certainly gives an impression that this will be supported for some time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whereas maybe paid upfront there's a little bit more of that safety net of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're paying for what it is now and not necessarily what it will be in the future.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I've never really thought of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:18.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I guess the idea was in your head that if you realize that this wasn't going to be worth</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your time or whatever, that you could, you can always turn the subscription piece off and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then make it just a paid up front or not paid up front, but a single price or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, but also people can cancel their subscription.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's the thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So just like hypothetically, if I decide a year and a half in that like, okay, I'm going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to, I'm going to wind down support for this app, which again, at this point, I absolutely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">don't think that's the case. Just to reiterate, launch has gone well and I'm really excited</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to keep building this thing. But in that situation, while it means that monthly subscribers,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if they want, can just stop writing a play and annual subscribers, they've only paid</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for two years. And if they're still getting value out of it, then they can just keep it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's sort of, no, that keeps the ball in the user's core. I like that. I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's funny hearing you describe it that way because it's the same insecurities, but yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">manifested sort of a different way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:20.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, so yeah, all that to say,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess the other thing I wanted to mention on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just found sort of shocking, frankly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just the percentage of people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are actually willing to pay lifetime</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for an app like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's just been a good lesson for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the very self-evident,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but not always intuitive idea</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that my purchasing behavior is not always representative</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of people's purchasing behavior.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">For me, just the reality for me is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if somebody on Twitter was hyping up this new app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a year and a half that they only worked on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in evenings and weekends and they finally shipped it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's a countdown app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, let me be careful about this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If it's an indiv, a developer I wanna support,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for sure I'll go and support them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like just generally speaking,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that type of situation is not the type of situation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where, yeah, I'll spend like $40 and hope that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, I continue to get value out of this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just like at the drop of a hat, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think you hit it though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You just hit it right there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like you're thinking these random people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on Twitter, why are they supporting me?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then when you reverse it and you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, you know, I won't give any specific examples,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, like a people that you know and respect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like even because I've definitely done that where I've bought lifetime versions of people's apps that I don't really intend to necessarily use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:56.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just really like the work that they do and I'll probably use it sometimes and I want them to be successful in this thing and keep going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:03.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And lifetime is honestly a lot of times better for that because then it's not a subscription sitting there and I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, I should probably cancel that because I don't really use this, but it's a person I like and I want, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, and I think the other thing too, that is just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:19.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I think is still just true is that I think software like this is severely undervalued,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">generally speaking, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:28.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, in a certain way, I don't like, I guess my fear was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:36.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that most people would absolutely balk at like spending $30,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">30 US dollars, which here is like 40 bucks,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on a countdown app, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my fear was that that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that would sound ridiculous to, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">99% of people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then, yeah, I guess all I'm trying to say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is on the other hand, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't think it's ridiculous.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I know it's not ridiculous</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I've spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and hundreds of hours building this thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's, this stuff takes time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think apps, I mean, we all know this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but apps I think for a long time have been severely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of devalued because of trends</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and sort of like, freemium models and trends</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just like free apps that sell your data to make money</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all that stuff that we don't need to get into.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But and just the concept of value for digital goods</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is really complicated to like comprehend.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, 'cause at a certain scale it's not devalued.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't know how to describe that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, software is weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or digital goods of any kind are weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you can make a lot of money or a little money,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it doesn't equate to the costs to making it in a way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that manufacturing pencil erasers has a cost.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know what I mean?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's a weird thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, which is why it's done so fresh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it does inevitable one star reviews that are just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is a scam.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How could you charge this much money for--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, a countdown app, like, it's like, I'm probably,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm probably making like 70 cents an hour on the work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've done right now, like, anyways, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But that's just the way it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So then how, let's see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So from a press angle, you mentioned that you did get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some press.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did that end up going?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there was a nine to five article.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I got a quick nine to five article.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think they're a couple other.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The funny thing, personally,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm just not even that plugged into a lot of these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of press outlets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I probably should be more so,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or to keep track of these things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I think there was a write up on I'm more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the thing that moved the needle the most in terms of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, this isn't press,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but in terms of sort of like external,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, external people writing about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or hyping up the app is there's a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's this Twitter account.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The account's name is basic Apple guy,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he's just got a bunch of followers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, he's actually, I don't really know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who this person is, but they're Canadian.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And somehow, you know, this person stumbled across</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">up ahead and was just totally enamored with it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and ended up tweeting about it a couple times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ended up writing this really nice,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like really well written review about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, to take nothing away from sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the typical press reviews that you sometimes get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with this stuff, like often they're fairly quick, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, I saw like nine to five writes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about a lot of stuff, and so often it's just a quick,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, hey, there's a new app here, here's what it does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But this was a very sort of loving blog post</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about actually how up ahead works</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and what this person likes about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyways, in this person, have a huge Twitter following.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that really helped move them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you don't give me sort of a second spike</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in terms of downloads beyond the initial launch day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that was cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's also just nice to, yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:11.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's really nice and validating to read something like that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to read somebody who's really putting the time into</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and gets it, recognizes the details you put in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and I guess that that's the key too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it's somebody who's to go way back</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the start of our conversation about the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I was saying that I was coming at this app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from a specific angle, which is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't just want countdowns on my home screen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want a more holistic view of my timeline of good things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so yeah, it's really cool when somebody seems to get that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that really resonates with them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you mentioned that was a sort of a secondary bounce.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:49.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So presumably you had the typical launch spike.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is a subscription app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So you do have recurring revenue,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but obviously downloads and stuff is still gonna have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that giant spike. How things gone since then were what a couple weeks out? Actually, I could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:06.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">look at my up ahead to see exactly when. Yeah, we're almost three weeks out now. Three</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:11.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">weeks out. Okay. Yeah. So how's it been going kind of since then? Yeah. I mean, I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:18.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how into the details. I want we want to get here, but I guess how it impacts you moving</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">forward. Like you mentioned, it's worth working on and then you kind of double down on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:29.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that. So basically I have been I've been pleasantly surprised by the tale, I guess, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:38.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like by by how frequently people still seem to be discovering and ultimately paying for the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:43.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's an indication that you've tapped into that existing market and not just, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your following slash tech Twitter. Yeah, that's the interesting thing. That's something that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's certainly the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's the next step for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like beyond the development work that I have left to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a lot of stuff I wanna do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A lot of features I wanna add to the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:03.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't, I'm not convinced yet that I've really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what the right, like analogy is here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but although the tail has been long,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:12.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not convinced that it is flat yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's still, like I'm not sure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I have actually sort of hit that point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where things are actually gonna flatten</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and maybe start to like go up again, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't think I've heard</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">certainly in terms of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:24.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app store optimization and stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I'm not there yet, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there are so many apps,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:32.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so many countdown apps that are ranking above me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and anything you would search for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:36.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, so I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess like I have been heartened yet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">by just how many people still seem to be discovering it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:43.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it seems to me like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:50.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's still largely either word of mouth or just sort of like still sort of Twitter bubble</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:59.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sort of fringes. And yeah, and the really exciting thing for me now is just that like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:05.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">relative, relatively speaking, I don't have like a ton of downloads yet. In other words,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:10.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there's a ton of untapped potential here, right? Like the 10th of the town was just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, the TAM is large and my slice of that right now is minuscule.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's negligible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I'm really excited to...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, I know there's something there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know there's a piece of that pie that I can go and grab.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:29.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm especially heartened by the fact that the people who are finding this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">many of them are actually converting and are leaving really good reviews.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And are giving me good feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, there's something here, there's excitement here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I need to go and find more eyeballs now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:52.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I guess like getting those download numbers, conversions, and good reviews, all of that stuff's presumably going to help your App Store optimization.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:57.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Have you gotten any like Apple features yet or gotten on any lists or anything like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:07.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What's funny is I didn't even realize I had, in fact, I think at some point, like, you know, we were talking and you asked me, like, "Oh, do you have any features?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I was like, no, weirdly, I don't.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:12.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I just wasn't looking properly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't know, I don't even know what I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I was using one of these tools on it anyways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It so happens that, yes, the app was on a few</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of these lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, what do you, do you think those lists do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">anything at this point?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think certain lists make a huge difference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think certain lists can.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's the trick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, so, and this is me a very much not expert</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that should not be broadcasting my opinions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to lots of people as if I know what I'm talking about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But here we go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, like for example, in for dark noise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew it's a similar thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a white noise app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's a trillion of them all with their own different things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some of them do stuff way better than me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Some of them are old, whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew it was going to be hard to compete</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on pure keywords and doing all that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause there's so many of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:07.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But if you search the word white noise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a list or a couple, depending on how you do your query</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and where you're at, that are like relaxing sleep sounds.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a curated list by Apple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had that as an explicit goal, because I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that feels like a cheat code to rank higher.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if I search that, sure, dark noise</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">might not show up at the top, but that list shows.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And a lot of people will click on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I presume countdown apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">might have similar things like that, but that almost feels like that type of things important,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:44.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">potentially. And then the other one is like new versions of iOS. If you get on the, on the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:52.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like great apps for dark mode or whatever this is, great apps or whenever the dynamic island</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:57.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">support comes in presumably they'll have a list for that. And if you can get in on that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which of course is maybe it's a fool's a folly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what the right word is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To spend all your time trying to go for those,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause it's like there's 10 apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and through no fault of your own,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you might not get chosen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I've definitely felt the effects</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for long periods of time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not just during that week of being in those lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I do think there's a lot of value</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I think a lot of that, if you build up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you build a good app, maintain a strong reputation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and good reviews,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">those just kind of come and you can't play the game going for them or at least I don't know how to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:39.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so the way I'm thinking about it right now along those lines is just yeah, my understanding of it is the same as you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:43.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, just to complete that last point, like yeah, I agree with you. I think a lot of those less can be valuable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:51.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the ones that are like when you're you know, like three swipes in on like the new and note</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or the utilities page, you know, like it's just like, there are certainly a lot of, a lot of those sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:02.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">automated lists that I don't think move the needle at all anymore. Right. But yeah, they're definitely,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:07.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're definitely something that do. I think the hidden thing is, is the fact that some of those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:12.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">will show up in search results. I think you make them have a bigger impact than it seems like a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">first blush. But so yeah, I mean, so I think, I think my goal now is I'm not going to, not going to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">worry about that too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:23.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the best thing I can do at this point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is keep building, is keep updating the app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like keep it active, keep talking about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keep trying to organically, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have people find it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:38.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I think my sense with those sort of app store features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:41.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is, well, like you said, I think they can sort of come</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:46.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if you can sort of show whether you're showing somebody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or just showing an algorithm that the app is active,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're actively updating it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're continuing to get good reviews,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I think there's just a certain profile</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:05.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of these types of apps that Apple wants to surface in those lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">>> Well, we use the word Apple often as an entity</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as if it's a singular thing, but I think a lot of those,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know this at all for a fact,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:21.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a fact. But my understanding through grapevines is that like there's kind of a like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">nomination thing that can happen internally. And I think that's part of why building up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:33.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that reputation using like Apple's API as well. Those types of things will increase the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:38.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">chance that somebody internally will notice and like your app and nominate it. And if</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">multiple people are nominating it from multiple angles, maybe it's more likely. It comes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">back to sort of the cliche of like, if you build a good thing, you don't automatically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:54.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get anything, but over time, your odds definitely are higher than if you're building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a sort of crummy thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I mean, so look out for live activity going up ahead.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Dynamic going just going to sit there the entire time, counting down to your birthday,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whether you like it or in the second.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's always going to be active in the dynamic island.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like forming into a feature request in my mind now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That would be interesting, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, 'cause once you get close,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it would be kind of fun, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know what it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:22.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Maybe.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It would give you, I think, some of the retweets,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe, more important than, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being an actually functional.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, maybe I'll just design it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and tweet a screenshot of it, and that'll be enough.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, so last thing, I actually just noticed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this the other day, you tweeted out a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't wanna call it a roadmap,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause that's the wrong word,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because similar to, I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">some themes we've talked about here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:49.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm guessing that as a result of you not wanting to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over commit yourself, you didn't put a timeline</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or even a specific order on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you sort of tweeted out a list of the different ideas</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're sort of mulling over.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was the thought process behind that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:08.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I think, so part of it is just that I have gotten</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of feedback through a whole bunch of different channels,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:13.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Email and Twitter mostly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And a lot of the feedback was very similar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A lot of feedback was touching on a lot of these features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I already kind of knew.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I had in the back of my mind as things I wish I could have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">gotten into V1.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'd definitely like to get to soon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so does that make sense?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:37.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This was just a nice way to sort of broadcast to--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess not everybody who's giving me feedback,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but certainly a good chunk of the people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who've given me feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I think the people who have given me feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are often the folks who are on Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like following the up ahead account,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I really invested in the app and have them for a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this is a way to sort of let everybody know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and one fell swoop that I hear you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And here's, I agree with you and here are a bunch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the things I wanna do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think the other thing is just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess I wanted to, how do I put it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm hoping to keep the excitement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the engagement up to some extent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I guess that's sort of where it comes from,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is that I wanna, my goal here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">while pacing myself, and not completely burning myself out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my goal is to keep sharing what I'm working on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I've been doing this whole time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's very much been,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the whole reason I've had built the momentum,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever momentum it did,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:37.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is because I was very forthcoming about sharing things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">often on Twitter and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just wanted to establish that I want to keep doing that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, and here are some things you can look for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I just thought it would be a good way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of pull people in, make them feel like they're--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even though we're past launch now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can still be a part of this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're sort of welcome into the club.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I still want to hear your feedback, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I guess that was the general thinking.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was saying, I didn't think too hard about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just sort of felt like a fun little thing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We have definitely gone a decent amount of time here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm glad we had time to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I'm not gonna let you go without asking the question</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I ask everybody, which is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so what is a person or people out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that have inspired you that you'd recommend</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">others check out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There's a ton, obviously.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is always a tough question</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause there's so many folks, again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like largely through Twitter for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who have really inspired me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's been really interesting to watch a lot of people's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">journeys doing very similar things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the type of stuff I'm trying to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:41.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I will, I think one person, I'll call it just because I think</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of the independent app that is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:49.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">closest in spirit, at least design wise,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to a lot of the work that I like to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's Brian Mueller's carrot.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know that's a very popular app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:02.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">certainly not a deep cut by any stretch. But the thing that really inspires me about his work and the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing that I strive to do in my work is the way that balances being a good platform citizen, building</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:19.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">apps that feel like iOS apps, while also just like being chock full of personality and interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">UI decisions and color and fun and that's, you know, up ahead definitely strives to do exactly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:32.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a really delicate balance, right, of like traditionally, I mean, every developer at some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:38.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">point has said, what if I'm trying to do what Apple would do if they built XYZ and that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">can take the form of, you know, it looks like the settings app, right, which is what Apple</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">would really do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:49.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you can also, like people would describe care at that way to certain degrees if you're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:54.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">looking at the actual features and the support and the system integrations it has, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:34:54.260 --> 01:35:01.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It does what you expect it to do as a platform citizen while also being completely insane</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the best way possible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:10.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, those are the apps that really, at least for me, probably in part as a, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:13.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">iOS developer, those really like hit home.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, one more personal call it quickly is Mustafa's task app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've just been really, so he, I think that app was launched</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like not long after O'Bother.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna say it was like June 2020 or something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:31.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when he launched that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, it was just like, as far as I understand,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's just a solo effort.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It wasn't the beginning.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:38.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It wasn't the beginning.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It wasn't the beginning.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so yeah, that's the part that is inspiring to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's just like how far it seems like he's been able to take that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:50.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, my understanding is he's actually got multiple folks working with him now on that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:57.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, that's just like he's really managed to turn that into a snowball that that has continued to roll.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:58.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's a great app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:02.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's just I think again, that's actually another good example of just like great platforms that is in.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:05.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But with some, you know, really nice design touches.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, just been really inspired over this whole time where I've kind of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:15.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've gone up and down on a bother and had a kid and had these times where I was totally</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:19.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">not doing anything and then ramped up on up ahead and got it launched.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's just been like making this thing happen and it's pretty cool to see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:25.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Those are excellent tonight.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very much share in those feelings.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I will try to wrap this up so you can go to sleep because I know it's over there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, it's almost laid over here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:39.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So where can people find you and your work and your blog that you're about to kick</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:45.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">off. Yeah, right away. People should look forward to that. Yeah. So I'm on Twitter at Daniel</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">M. Goatee. If you don't know how to spell that, I assume it'll be in the show notes. The blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:55.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is Daniel Goatee.me. I believe. Anyway, yeah, those are the two places you can find me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes, it is. And the upper head apps specifically on Twitter is, I believe, at the upper</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Awesome. Well, thank you for coming on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This was really fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, as shown by me, maybe taking it too long,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:15.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I've been looking forward to this for a really long time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've tried, I have a problem with gushing over apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot on this, but this happened particular.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">From the first time you sent me one of the screenshots,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people who followed me for a long time know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:33.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I like tweeting out widgets of whatever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:35.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">countdown app of the week I was using.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so it hit a very specific thing for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the timeline view just totally clicked with me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a way that I open the app every day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not just a widget app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It really is like things I'm looking forward to.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I let things that I shouldn't put in there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that are not positive things sneak in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's actually convenient.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:00.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But for the most part, it's just this like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">joyous little bundle of happiness that I get to open</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the morning to remind myself of when</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the next movie I'm looking forward to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:11.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">your video game or event with my kids or whatever is happening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I cannot recommend the F enough to people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm so glad that you got it out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that it's good enough that you're gonna keep it alive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause selfishly I just want this thing to survive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, um, and yeah, I'm excited to see what's next.</p>
