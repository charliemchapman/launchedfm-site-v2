<p class="time-stamp">00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Welcome to Watch, I'm Charlie Chapman and today I'm excited to bring you the developer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:24.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>behind the wonderful recipe app, Kruton, Devin Davies.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Devin welcome to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Thanks for having me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I am. I'm super excited about this one. People who know me know that I spent a little while</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>kind of just going through a lot of recipe apps. Probably a lot of people I'm sure will get into</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>this, but I came off of one app that's been around for a very long time and then maybe was ready</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to try some other things and turns out there's a bunch of really cool apps. I've interviewed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>some of them here. Krewton is one that I kind of have fallen in love with. There's a lot of little</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>details that I'm sure we're going to get into that I just I just find very very delightful in a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>way that's very satisfying and so I'm I'm really happy to have you on finally to kind of talk</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>about this. Appreciate it. Thank you. So before we get into crouton itself though I want to give</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>everyone a background on who you are. So the first question or the questions I always ask everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>is where you from do you have a formal education related to what you do and then we can talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>your career leading up to croutan. Sure, so I'm from Christchurch New Zealand. You might go to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>town from from the accent. I grew up in a smaller town outside of Christchurch called Kaya</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Poi, which probably no one's heard of, but they have more cafes per capita than any other town</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in the world, I'm sure. I'm just assuming it looks exactly like Lord of the Rings, but with with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>more cafes and taeko with TT around around. That's right. Yeah, we take boat everywhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I threw it all my knowledge, I'll just throw it in there once.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh, and sheep. There's lots of sheep, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, plenty of sheep.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, so it's a good place. It's pretty like terrible holiday destination.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>If you're coming to New Zealand, don't come to Christchurch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But it's a great place to live.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh, there's just nothing to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's very, it's flat and quiet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So if you want a relaxing chill holiday, then maybe it's a good place.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And you like coffee.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, if you want to see me, then...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's literally the best place in the world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for that. Yes, yeah, you'd be hard-pressed to find many URLs. It's a good landing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>pad. We're pretty close to Queenstown and Teacupone, all these touristy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>destinations. So you normally fly into Christchurch and then drive out as quickly as</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you can. But then that gives you quick access to them for a weekend trip or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>something like that. Yeah, that's true. Definitely very lucky to have lots of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>super nice spots close by. So it's not all bad. Nice. Let's talk about your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>education then, did you decide early on you wanted to get into app development or something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So originally I, when I was at teenager, my dad's work had an old C6 Photoshop license.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>They didn't need anymore.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I got a legal copy of the creative suite.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I started, I was kind of into photography originally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then that kind of morphed into just using Photoshop to do a whole bunch of different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Viktor things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I thought for a while that I wanted to be a graphic designer, I don't know what's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's like in the US though, but I think here that can be a tougher industry to get into.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Well then, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so my dad who's a software developer kind of, I guess, sort of suggested that maybe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'd give this a go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I'd always been, I guess, like Apple obsessed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I remember unboxing and I met, I met G3 at primary school and I think that was my first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>kind of like interaction with an Apple product.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it's like, yeah, I like whoever made this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I think kind of, I've ever since then, I've always, before these are live stream</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the events, me and my brother would, would stay up all night for some reason.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then at five a.m., which is when they start in New Zealand, we'd watch the live</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>blogs and then go to school.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Ah, those were, those were good times.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Those were fun ways to consume those key notes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That sounds weird saying it like that, but it definitely had a different feel to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, yeah, you're getting it, I guess through someone else's perspective, I don't know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it was always good to have a few tabs open in case one of them went down and you needed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to jump between different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Well, I've probably said it here before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but that's the original reason I joined Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Because of all places, Woot,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>if you've ever heard of Woot,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that was probably an American thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was-- - Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- One of those daily deals sites,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but their whole stick was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>they wrote like really fun,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like they had comedy art or comedians on staff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to write these crazy descriptions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of whatever their deal the day was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And for some reason, Woot would live blog</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Apple Keynote's on Twitter, specifically.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And on Twitter, you could sign up to have it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>send them as text messages to your phone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And when I learned that they did that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I was like, oh, while I'm in class,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>this is when I was in college,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I can get those on my phone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I can keep up with the live blog.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But they're making jokes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like it's literally just jokes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I could at least be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>oh, they announced a new laptop,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or they announced a new thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- You get a rough idea of what's happening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was like the weirdest way to keep off with a keynote, but there you go. So that's that's why I started out on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I think it'd be hard to go back now now that we've got the live streams and especially the super polished video events</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Going back to just like a text feed. I think I'd probably struggle but back in the day it was like highlighted the year. Oh, yeah</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, so you went into did you go to university then for this? Yeah, so from after high school I went to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Can a university into the computer science degree?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>In retrospect, I don't know that you definitely don't need to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's a lot of stuff I think that I had to learn that hasn't been that useful,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it also gives you a good idea of, I guess, like the deep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>valuables of the way things work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So you can make some better decisions, even though most of the time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when we're programming, we're sort of at a much higher level these days</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>than some of the things they teach you at university.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess it's good to have an appreciation of those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I definitely felt like for the first two years of uni,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when it was a lot of that theory that I really just didn't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>have a clue what I was doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like I could do enough to pass the papers and things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it didn't really click.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I was sort of unsure if I'd made the right cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, it's sort of a weird thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with college versions of computer science where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and maybe this is just people like us</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>who are more into the, well, like you said,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the graphic design side of things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but building apps is fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like I know people who do those SwiftUI tutorial things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and they're not planning to make a career out of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>They just, like it's kind of an addicting fun thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I never once in college until maybe like later</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when I was doing senior project type stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>got into that addicting flow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with 'cause it was all like learn how to do this database query</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and make it, you know, this time this month faster</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or deal with big O notation or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it's like, those are probably good to have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it would be nice, especially in the early stages</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for it to have that addicting piece.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then you love on the necessary, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>your vegetables to go with the candy, I guess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- That's right, yeah, 'cause I just wanted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to make buttons look nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so when you're having to do all this extra stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's a bit much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But in my third year, we had this like full year group project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where we built an app to view the America's Cup feed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause they had just like a live API,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>so you could pull in the boats</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>they wear and plot them on a map.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>The America's Cup and then you said boats.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>See, I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't even know what that is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Or maybe I do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Should I know what that is?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's got a miracle in the title.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I wasn't aware of what it was until the group project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh, OK.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Vaguely aware that it involves boats and competition.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>OK.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I'm kind of raised to them, I guess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, they race boats, particularly kind of boats, around lakes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm going to do a terrible job of explaining what it is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I just wanted to make buttons look pretty.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>In typical fashion, I've already derailed this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and it's the least important part of this story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So you're making an app about the boats.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yes, that's right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Luckily, this will save it in the middle of the year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>we pivoted and turned it into a game</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because the America's Cup finished, so the feeds stopped.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so then we changed it to be more of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you know, the Jackbox games?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So we pretty much took that idea and made it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>so you could log into a room from your phone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and that would give you a control pad</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then you could pilot a boat around on the main screen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and kind of race against your friends, which is pretty cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Wait, so was that my phone app then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It was just a web page on the phone itself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the extra application itself was just like a Java,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was written in Java and ran on the Mac.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, it was really that group project</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where I got very fortunate with the people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>who was on the team with me and learned like a whole bunch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>from that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And that was where it kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>everything kind of fell into place,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like I had all the pieces from the previous years,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but working on that with those people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was we're not kind of clicked.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I was like, oh, this is what I want to be doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I got to do a lot of the design work</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>on that project, too, which was pretty cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So you graduate with a computer science degree, then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Coming out of that, what was your,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like did you go straight into app development</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or were there some, you know, twists through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>some other languages or something?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I think I've been very fortunate</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with kind of the way things have fallen into place for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And basically I finished my degree and then I think I downloaded Xcode and my sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>get between finding a job and sort of spent a week or two just mucking around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I didn't really know what I was doing then either.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just remember dragging buttons from the storyboard into view controller and making</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it print out things when you tapped on them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's a through line with buttons here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You like buttons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just love buttons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's a big, big button fan.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>[laughter]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Well, they just go to Fidget with,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like I still miss 3D Touch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause it was just a great kind of fidget</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when you were sitting there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just sort of pressing on the--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Like here Jordan Morgan,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like just siding through the podcast,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>pipes, when you call that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- The old podcast pipes, yep.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- That's the goal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And so I interviewed for a few jobs,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and there was this company I'd randomly come across</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>online, Coach Smudge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But they didn't have any applications at the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I applied for this other job and went through the process of that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but then didn't end up getting that role.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And the recruiter that was helping me was like, "Oh, why don't you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>apply this company?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it just happened to be,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>"Smudge the company that I looked out online and thought,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>"Oh, it'd be cool to work there."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:46.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I interviewed there and got the job and started that after my summer break.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And that was doing eye-wist development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I kind of did just land it straight into eye-wist development without any</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>real experience, but then yeah, just very fortunate to sort of learn as I was was working.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Okay, so you've been doing this pretty much your whole professional career then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I've done a little bit of Android and Web, but iOS is definitely the one I find the most exciting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:13.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So then what is what got you and you still work there then, right? Is that correct?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>What if you want to talk about that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yep, yeah, so I still work there mostly full time and then yeah, just to crut on on the side.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>aside. So it's quite, it can be quite a good like I think relationship when you've got a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>side project and a work project that are the same technologies. You can learn things at home that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>are really helpful at work and vice versa. So you can almost like hack your, I don't know, like the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>whole 10,000 hours thing, you can kind of like fast track that if you're passionate about doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it in your spare time. That was, again, I've probably said this before on this podcast, but with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>dark noise, that was the whole point of it is I switched, you know, from where I react side of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of things to an iOS team.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I didn't know iOS development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I'm like, I need to start a side project.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And part of that too was all the people on my team</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>are not all.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But a lot of them also had side apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And the amount of times we'd be in a meeting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and we'd be like, can we do this with App Store Connect?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And everybody would be like, well, I've done this here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh, I've used this over here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like everybody could kind of pull in this experience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with these little side apps that they had.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I definitely found the same thing for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was like almost addicting when you could pull out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>your laptop, like your personal laptop,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and be like, I solved this problem earlier,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and you could find some old code.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Totally.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I never really had that doing dotnet enterprise apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I wasn't usually building those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:40.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and deploying them to local enterprise apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>[LAUGHS]</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>No, hey, you want to spin your evenings?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I think as well, especially around like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>dubbed up when all the new APIs and things come out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You don't always get an opportunity straight away</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>through like a day job to use those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but like when you're just on your own projects,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you can do whatever you want</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and you don't have to sort of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess justify it or have a reason to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So you can pick up those things really quickly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then often they do come in useful later on down the line.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- So is that why you started building stuff on the side?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I think I, once I started doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I always developed a minute work,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just found that I enjoyed it so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I just wanted to keep doing it when I got home</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I guess I've always head like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I know there's like pain points of the way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that you might be doing something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so when you suddenly develop a skill</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where you can solve those pain points yourself,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's sort of hard not to at least give it a go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, it's the, like I'm having a small problem</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with my garage door and I like Raspberry Pies.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Therefore, I need some giant Rubgolwer machine</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that attaches a Raspberry Pi to my garage door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's the same thing that I've written, but with apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think the problem is having someone, not having someone they had to tell you that you should</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just stop and just enjoy some peace and quiet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess you had a full-time job and you were just kind of like making apps for fun, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>on the side, were you doing apps like pushing them to the store and trying to make kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of a business out of them or most of them sort of personal side project kind of things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>before crew time?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, it was mostly personal, I guess you would say.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So the first app I built was for my youth group just as a way to keep track of the different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>events we had on because often you'd have like a printed plan but then things would change</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and the printed plan would be kind of useless.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so the first app I built was just something you could open up and see what was happening</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that week and there were changes as things updated.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think in retrospect that could have probably just been a Google calendar but it was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>a good opportunity to practice sort of building my own thing and seeing what that might</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>look like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So then what what led you up to crew time itself then? I guess kind of similar when I my wife and I got married</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>We started meal planning just as a way to keep groceries cheap and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's also just makes it easy when you're working out what you want to cook. I'd always enjoyed cooking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't like I don't think I'm particularly amazing at it, but it's something I've always sort of enjoyed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I was the the chief meal planner in the house</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's my official title and to start with I was just using the notes app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So at the top I just had the days of the week and then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>underneath that I had a just a massive list of URLs and even some type</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>out recipes. So you kind of just infinite scroll find something that looks good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then paste it up the top which works surprisingly well for a while. Like you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>get iCloud sharing in a notes you can share it with your family. Yeah yeah I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>think the notes happen general is great. There's a lot of like app ideas that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you can kind of manage for a while just as a note until they get unwieldy. If</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>If we get links to other notes inside of Apple notes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's gonna be a killer app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I mean, it's a killer app now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I feel like that's kind of the one piece missing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It'll put us all out of a job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I would just use notes for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I don't really remember making a conscious decision</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to start making crouton.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think it was just one Saturday.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I had some spare time and just sort of started putting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>something together to see what it might look like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And originally it was really focused around,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess coming from the note,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>right, it's head links and recipes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was actually really focused on the meal planning</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and less about being able to view recipes in the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so originally it really was just like a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you would just paste links in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then you could attach those links</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to the days of the week.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I guess the benefit was that you could search it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and things like that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it really didn't have any focus on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>being able to do anything interesting with the recipes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Like when you wanted to use one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you're just opening up that page in the browser.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Basically, yeah, just like Safari View controller</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then there it was, which I don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like I don't think I shipped that version of it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but that's what it was for quite a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I think, as I went on, it was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>okay, I'm gonna have to actually display ingredients</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and steps and figure out how to make these things look</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>sensible and all those sort of, I guess complications</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that you don't think will be issues</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>until you start trying to build it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And like at this point in the story,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's more or less for you still then, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like when did you kind of transition to like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>oh, this is gonna be like a product</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm gonna try and sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Ah, that was pretty often.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Definitely after it launched, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh, after it launched?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh, I guess we can get into the launch soon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But yeah, while I was building it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it was definitely like, this is gonna make things easier for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess always do it, you're sort of thinking like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>oh, it'd be nice if other people use this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I don't think I had really thought about that too much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Okay, it wasn't like grand plans</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>about taking over the recipe app space</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and doing market research and all that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was really like, this is the thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that will be nice for me and it'll be cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like a lot of projects to put it out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like if it was a website, it'd be cool to put it out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and tweet about it or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, yeah, I definitely didn't do any product market</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for anything like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was just like, this would be good for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I had done a search of the App Store</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just to kind of see what was around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Obviously, like, Pet Precor kind of owns the space,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>did and still does in a lot of ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I think at the time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just didn't wanna pay eight dollars.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>In retrospect, that probably would have been a good deal</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and would have saved me a lot of stress and high brake.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But yeah, a lot of the meal planning apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause that was kind of my angle,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>we're really focused on health and that side of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Right. - And just the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just wanna cook something tomorrow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I'm gonna organize that at the start of the week.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I originally in crouton as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you could only, you were not assigning recipes to dates,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you were just assigning them to the day of the week.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So it was like really, really basic.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Basically at the start of the next week,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you'd have to clear the list</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then add in the recipes again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh yeah, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- So there's like a lot of decisions I made</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that I think made it clear that it was built</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just for the way that I used recipes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then over time, as people have actually started using it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>then I've sort of tried to, I guess soften some of those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>still have an opinion and the way things should be done, but also take feedback and sort of refine things a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:06.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So based on how you are describing it, I'm guessing there wasn't a big beta test group</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or anything like that. What was the state of the app and then what was the actual launch itself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like then, the initial launch? Yeah, I don't even know if I'm allowed to be on this show because I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>know if you can really call it a launch. But I-- Well, it went from existing to not existing. So</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>The boat ended up in the water, I think that's...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yes, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So at that point I really, I had been on Twitter for a long time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I actually didn't follow a lot of people in like the like I always develop a space.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I had started tweeting about it a little bit, but I actually I checked earlier today</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>before coming on to see like what I had done leading up to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I think I tweeted once, showing a little video of it automatically detecting something on your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>clipboard popping up. Another screenshot of it running on catalyst, and then the post after that was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the launch tweet. And so there was really like no kind of I guess like you know trying to build</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>up hype or see if there's any interest it was kind of just like hey run I made a recipe at and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that was kind of it. And the screenshot of it was not very thought through it was like a recipe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:12.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that I just quickly typed up which had like the ingredients was a chicken breast and two tablespoons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of curry powder and that was like the screenshots. Yeah I clearly was not thinking at all about how</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>how to sort of present this as something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that other people might want to use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It's so interesting because I came into understanding</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or knowledge of this later,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but everything you do now feels like very thought through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and there's little jokes hidden in places.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I feel like you do really think through that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I'm curious how you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like how did you get from there to where you are right now then?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I think I'm making up for lost time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'Cause basically I launched in 2019</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and it got, I think, two downloads on the first day,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which was me and my mom.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So, it went very well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>She thought it was a good app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- A small but very loyal user base.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I think it was what you said.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, well she still uses it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So, that's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Must have done it right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So it was actually, I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>well most of the whole year or at least six to eight months</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when no one was really using it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I was still working on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It was good at least that it had solved a problem for me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and was legitimately useful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Was it paid up front or one time purchase an app purchase, which is what I think of this today?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I think when I launched it was free and then there was an app purchase to unlock</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>iCloud sinking. Okay, that did not do very well. And so then after a few months, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>changed it to paid up front, which also just made it easier to develop because I didn't have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to worry about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah. You get through app reviews so much faster and exactly. It's funny. I mean, by the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>time this comes out, it'll be old, but I've been tweeting, I think today or last night,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and remember about thinking about changing things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with dark noise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it's one of those words,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like it's exciting thinking about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but man, paid up front is so much easier.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like as much as there's a reason why everybody says not to do it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I understand that from a business sense,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but you avoid so much work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Definitely, surprisingly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- There's definitely a lot of positives about paid up front,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it's hard to convince people to download it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, you're asking people to put a lot of money down</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>on something, or not a lot, but you don't even</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>put money down on something based on no real reputation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just what they can see in screenshots.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And you're up against a bunch of things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that usually they have to put no money down to try it out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, and I think switching to pay upfront</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was also not the right move because then I was basically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like direct comparison to Pet Reaker and other apps where--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm amazed at how little the app did when I shipped it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And in retrospect, I probably should have, I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>held off for a few extra months and just tidied up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>a few extra things and launched it then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think it was just good to get something out the door</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and start using it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I think what happened after that was I started really</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>getting into the developer community a lot more</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and realizing that there's a lot of other people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>trying to do very similar things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I just started getting really inspired</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>about all the different things you see people working on on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And also looking at how they, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>market their new features and their updates</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and post about things and I guess trying to analyze</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>what works and what doesn't work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I think, yeah, now when I post things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm definitely thinking about that a lot more,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>probably too much at this point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but just around like, I don't know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>trying to get the perfect screen recording of a feature</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or exactly how something's gonna look</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when someone else views it without any context</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So a lot of that I think I've just built up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>from looking at how other people do things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and kind of trying to, I guess, copy what I think works well</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and trying to do it, I guess in my own way too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but yeah, just looking at how other people are doing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- So I feel like, I mean, I don't know the reality.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So maybe my perception is way off here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I feel like there's more than two users.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Well, three, 'cause I'm one of them using the app now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So like, what sort of changed the tide on something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that was another app in the store,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:11.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>wasn't getting a lot of attention to something that seems like at least a genuine business.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:18.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think there was a release I put out in early 2020. It was like kind of after COVID hit and I was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>at home a lot more and I think I just focused on all the sort of key points that I was getting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like I I was sort of getting a few users over time and so I started to get a little bit of feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and so there was a release I put out that added like grocery planning and it made the meal</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>plan infinite so you could plan into the future as much as you want. And a few</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>extra things in that release that I think kind of took up from being just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>something that solved my problem to being legitimately useful for other</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>people. And I definitely kind of see that as kind of a marker of where it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:55.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>established itself as it as an app. Was there like a notable maybe not jump as the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>wrong word but growth that happened after that? I think most of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>croutons growth has been pretty gradual. There's definitely been like some spikes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like I got picked up by Mac Stories late 2020, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And that also was a really great way to kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just get out in front of other people and be seen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so there's definitely been like some spikes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where different things have happened,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like App Store features and things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I would say on the whole,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Creton's growth has been really kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>progressive over time, which is like good and bad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Sometimes those big spikes can be a little bit,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess, depressing when you come back down from them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You just want to share the feeling of massive growth overnight again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>whereas then when it's just sort of gradual over time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's a bit more sustainable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it's like, okay, I just keep doing this and focusing on what I think makes a good product,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>then hopefully it'll continue down that path.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So did you find that after those spikes, the tail sort of continued,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like you got some growth out of that or were those really just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like if you just got rid of those, yes, you'd lose the money from those spikes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but they didn't necessarily affect the overall trajectory of the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like, or was most of the growth, I guess, coming from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the sort of day-to-day grounding or were those spikes, the things that were</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>kind of driving some of that growth, I guess, is what I'm really asking.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I guess it's hard to know exactly. My, I'd definitely be interested to see</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>what other people with their experiences being, but typically after those,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I found that it levels off sort of just a little bit above where it was before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but certainly not like, while it's happening, I'm like, oh, this is awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm gonna be like, you know, number one forever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, James Thompson, he was talking about when they released,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like when the App Store first came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So there was no stories or history to go with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>They all were projecting out like these numbers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>over the next half of many years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And they're like, oh my gosh, we're gonna be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>millionaires.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Exactly, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I think in my experience has been that after that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it levels off somewhere slightly above where it was previously,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but not anything significant.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I think for me what's worked has been just, over time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>building up a presence on Twitter and kind of just sharing what I'm working on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then just the consistency of delivering and trying to add new things that will be helpful,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think, then over time, then the word of mouth of your product spreads, and then it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>builds up that way, at least that's been my experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I want to talk about a couple of those features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:32.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So, like, I guess one of the more standout ones is the blink.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But what do you actually call the feature?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's like blink detection for how you actually navigate while you're running through your steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I think it's just called like wink mode or hands-free mode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's, yeah, that's the word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>How'd that come about?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That one was interesting because I didn't have a step-by-step mode in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and crewed on it all before that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I think I was just driving home from work one day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I don't know, daydream or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I was like, oh, be cool if I could like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>move through the recipe without having to touch the screen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It'll be kind of fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I guess just thought,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like, I could do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then yeah, just thought about the true depth camera.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Or you don't even need the true depth.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Now you just, just the front camera</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with the face detection.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then it's like, oh, yeah, maybe I could detect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>if you're winking or opening your mouth.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And that could be a way to move through the steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I really thought it was kind of like a gimmick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I wasn't sure if I was actually going to ship it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it took like a week to get it through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>at preview as well because they kept sending back feedback.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like, where are you using TrueDip then your app?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it just took a very long time to explain like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>some check boxes checked and then they need to actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>go find that which makes your app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>pretty slow I guess probably every time now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I think yeah, this point I've gotten on that feature</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>specifically, I've worked out exactly what I need to include</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to kind of avoid having to answer questions about that one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but yeah, there's definitely some good videos of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like late at night, winking at my phone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to submit as proof.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But those would never be distributed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- So you were saying, you weren't sure</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>if that was gonna be, if you thought it was gonna be a gimmick,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I mean, I think it probably is still a gimmick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I do use it occasionally, but it landed a lot better</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>than I thought it was going to,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause I just thought it was kind of like a goofy thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that'd be fun to put together and see if I could make it work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:23.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But then almost every time now, when it gets picked up by someone, they often mention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that as a key feature, which I just find amusing because to me, it's just like a little</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>thing I kind of like threw in as something fun that I could do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>We've talked outside of this podcast a couple times and you sometimes make fun of me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for not using step-by-step mode.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I will say, I do find myself now using Cooton.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>If I'm cooking certain things, like if I'm chopping vegetables or whatever, and it's a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>recipe, I don't know as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I will set up my phone because I don't use a kitchen iPad, which I know you're also a big</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>guy for one of the big believer in the kitchen iPad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'll grab one of this little, nobody can see this except for you, but I have one of these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>little phone stand things that every iOS developer probably has.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I'll grab that from my office and bring it down to my kitchen and set my phone up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just so that I can blink through the,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it sounds weird saying that loud,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>blink through the steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Because I'm the worst, I'm a horrible cook</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in terms of time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm just a very slow person in general</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>as dark noise development in the test.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And this applies to cooking as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I will double triple check recipes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like I will look at the number of ounces</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or whatever the actual scale I need for something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I'll go grab the thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then I'll look again to see what the number is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then I'll unscrew the cap,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then I'll look again at what the number is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I just instantly forget it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I don't think that's a U problem.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I do exactly the same thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, it's like, oh, I'd be able to check that again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah. - And get it wrong.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, like, I've probably messed up one time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>early in my life, and now every single time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I have to check a thousand times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I don't want to have some childhood trauma.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, double the amount of chili powder or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so with that, I won't do this if my family's home</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I know I look really goofy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I genuinely, really, really love it for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'Cause is it opening your mouth?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Is that what it is to pull down the ingredients?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, if you're on an iPhone or like a compact view,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>yeah, then opening your mouth will pop up the English.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And that's the one I use very frequently</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>actually surprisingly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's interesting, I thought your story was gonna be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for that was going to be the typical iOS developer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I was watching WWDC videos about Vision Kit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I wanted to workshop this in,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it sounds like you actually came at that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>from the solving a problem perspective,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>even though you thought it was gonna be a gimmick.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, that one just kind of, yeah, came out of nowhere</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then sort of head all the right pieces</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to put it together, which was cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And it's interesting, I feel like I've seen other apps do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>similar things, not maybe not the exact same method,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but like the idea of a, I have messy hands,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>way of navigating through steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I've seen other people do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I'm guessing that is like a feature</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that lots of people probably use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I can't be the only one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Now I'm wishing that there's like a video compilation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of all the users just like opening their mouth</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I'm winking at their phone to attract steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, there's another business opportunity for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You can secretly capture the video and then, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>have a 999 unlock to not tweet it to all your friends</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or message it to all your friends or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Blackmail as a service.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Back to your point quickly about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Dub Dub, sort of, and using that as like a catalyst for features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I have worked on a few different variations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of the hands-free mode as a result of seeing stuff at Dub Dub,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like they brought out the hand pose detection</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I have played around with being able to navigate</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the recipe just using your hands instead</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I think, and part of why I guess I think I thought</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was again like, when King Lifton right can be kind of a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>fatiguing exercise if you want to move through a lot of steps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I think there's definitely some,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>probably some other interesting sort of ways</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that, yeah, you could add a layer of interaction</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>without having to actually touch the screen.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It seems like there would be a accessibility angle to that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>even though that wasn't necessarily your original intent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Have you heard from people who use it in that kind of context</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or have requests for a similar kind of context?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I don't think so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I have mostly had the opposite way people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>let me know that it's quite hard to wink,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>lift and write, over and over again.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, it would be quite interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to know if that is actually useful or not.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I guess in that case, voiceover</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>is kind of more the answer there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You've got like the system layer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So there's not necessarily,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>as long as you conform to the platform conventions for accessibility,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you're kind of getting a lot of that for free.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So like another thing, this isn't really a specific feature, but this is more or less the thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that really makes me love this app. I feel like there's a lot of just delightful custom controls,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like in particular, if you're like in the grocery app, I guess it's when you're inputting a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>recipe to the like custom, you know, scale, what do you call that, the like card view that comes up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for putting in the number of like the ingredient,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>keypad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- There you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's the word I'm looking for, the ingredient keypad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That thing is amazing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>What led you to building a custom control like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, that one's kind of a little bit funny</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I spent, actually, so originally,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the inspiration for that kind of layout</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>actually came from Daniel Gautier's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>O'Bother app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>He kind of has those kind of little cars.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh really?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I had, I'd been for a while trying to work out like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>how can I make the ingredient input better?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Because like typing out things like fractions and stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>on a keypad can sometimes be a pain,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>especially if you're modifying a recipe ingredient,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's nice to kind of have something that's aware</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that it's a recipe and not just the default keypad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I actually spent like a whole weekend</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>building something quite different where it was more like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>steppers where you could like quickly add</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and remove amounts in stepping increments,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and sunk quite a lot of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and to try to make that good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and solving a lot of challenges</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that came with that approach.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I think by the end of the weekend,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I was like, "This is not good."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like this is definitely worse than the normal keypad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so kind of scrapped the whole thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then really quickly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or at least comparably to the amount of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I spent on the first version,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>sort of built out what it looks like now,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where it's more of just a keypad</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where you type it out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and you can choose the quantities and things like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But yeah, it's always interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when you sync a lot of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>into something that can be quite easy just to be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>"Okay, well this is what I'm gonna go with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I've spent so much time on it."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I'm glad with that that I didn't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and that I was able to come up with something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that I guess kind of still has the same,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the essence of what I was going for with the other thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but ends up being a much more obvious solution, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I think the thing is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>there is the easy answer to develop,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which is use the keypad that Apple built.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And you know, that's gonna work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And, you know, that's that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And that's what most other apps I use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's also some that do like little extra buttons</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that float above the key-to-head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And those work okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But this is like, there's a bunch of examples in the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But this is the one that I remember the first time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I used the app is the thing that made the whole thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>really stand out as a high quality experience,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which is like, this is an action I'm gonna do frequently.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And there's a way to do it that's dedicated specifically</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to this task and it's gonna do it really smooth</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and easily and quickly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And once you do that, it's sort of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>lets you know what you're about to experience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with everything else, which is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>expect everything to have this level of like polish</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>around it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I'm glad you think so.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I remember actually I don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>another thing that actually did help with Croton's growth</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was when you discovered the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and you, 'cause I had made like a launched style icon</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of the app and then just sort of tweeted it out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like, please notice me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Was that back when I was trying to fill my whole screen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with all launched F-I-Guys?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And I think you must have installed it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause it was gonna help fill the screen</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then you obviously opened it and started using it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and you posted a video of like, oh, look at this ingredient</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>keypad and I was like, oh no, please don't show everyone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>what I've been doing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's kind of like a, I don't know if you feel this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it's really bizarre seeing people actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>use your app. And I always find the buds. It's a very uncomfortable experience of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>please don't break, please don't break.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:55.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It doesn't help that. For me, like you built Kirton and you were the main user,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because you said you were the person who who cooked all the time. I built dark noise</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:05.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because my wife uses a white noise app every night. And I very occasionally do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:11.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but not very often. And what I found is my wife is very good at finding bugs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And they would come up at night,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause that's when she would hit play on the thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And like constantly, like I would like get anxiety</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>going to bed when she pull her phone out sometimes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because, you know, she'd be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- You know, three a.m.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, or like it wouldn't fade up correctly</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or it would sound, even if she didn't say anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's just like this like tense feeling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I very much know that I've never seen anybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in the wild using it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>even if it was super popular.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't know that that's something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that I would ever really expect to see,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but I'm definitely not there either.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But yeah, whenever people tweet a screenshot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of here's a mix I made or whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's always that same feeling of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I should be proud, but.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It's like heart rate just goes straight up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's like doing a live demo somehow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's the same kind of feeling, I guess.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It's just very stressful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, I think, and going back to your,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that your wife giving feedback,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I actually think that's one of the key</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>parts of crewton success as well as actually like when I build something I'll show it to my wife</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like oh what do you think of this and because she's got no context of what I've been trying to achieve or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Exact knows you might see an age is on something and so you're just committed to it because you've put in the effort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so having someone that can just look at it and be like mmm, I think like you can do better than this or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:32.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>She's always very nice about how she delivers the feedback which she's also very good at pushing me on things that I probably should</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Try harder on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:41.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>She's also very good at finding bugs. So whenever she's cooking, she usually comes with a list of feedback afterwards on what I could do, Bada.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh, man. Yeah, it's I mean, it really is like that's the best thing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Is somebody somebody who's not you?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Because like when I'm using my own software, I feel like I'm tiptoeing around it all the time anyway.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So to me everything I make feels like it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:03.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's a house of cards. That's about to fall apart. No, I mean like I feel like everything's going to break</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- If I just touch it wrong, you know what I mean?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I probably, or not probably,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I definitely don't use it probably</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like a normal person would.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:16.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, my wife is good about using it like a normal person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And same for, you know, it's like you're saying,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you see that out like your mom was using it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And once you get users giving you feedback,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's amazing how they can represent the normal person</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for a lot of use cases where you never are going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to be the normal person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I'm not even getting ironing out those,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or rounding out those rough edges, the sharp corners?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Man, there's a phrase there that I'm dancing around</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and I'm just...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- You hit all of the right words, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- All right, perfect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I at least got all the right words at some point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Maybe not the right order all at once,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but we got there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I think use a feedback has been really,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's great when you get an email or like a message</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>from someone that you can tell they,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess have the same vision of the Apple water can be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so you can tell that the feedback is sort of like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>really in line with your own, I guess, views of what you're trying to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And yeah, I think it's always really exciting when you find a user like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that you can kind of bounce ideas off of or get their feedback on how they sort of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>interpreted a feature when they first saw it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And yeah, I always try and, when I get that kind of feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>implement those changes as quickly as I can.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, for sure, especially when you're like, when you're in the earlier stage</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of building something and you're excited and you integrate that feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:39.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>quickly, you get into this really addicting loop of making people happy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like I don't know, there's nothing better than the somebody sending you an email and then</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>you like, like I would do this with test flights, especially getting a test flight out with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then, you know, putting in the notes like, thanks, Bob.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And you're just kind of like, yeah, like maybe they don't care, but I feel like I made</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>their day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like it just feels really special.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, it's really really satisfying and then that encourages more people to want to send you that feedback and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That like cycle gets going again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Definitely I've been in that in a while and it's it's almost depressing when you're not because it I don't know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It makes it so much easier to kind of get into that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That flow I feel like yeah, I think it's definitely one of the most helpful things when you're kind of in like a a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Slump of motivation. Yeah, if someone just sends through something like oh, hey, it'd be cool if it did this thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You just can like jump in and smash it out whereas I find when I'm working on like bigger features</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's way easier just to sort of I guess not not do any work on it because I know that if I do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm gonna have to tackle this really big problem and so those little things are great kind of like funnels where you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:47.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You do the little thing and then you suddenly find that you're working on the big challenging thing again without kind of noticing and so it's just a good</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Wave getting back into it. Yeah, there's quality. It's nice to have like quality of life</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Quick wins, I guess would be the the corporate term for it, but it could yeah, I can really kickstart things again</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess speaking of that it feels like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>From the outside at least you've been going through or you just went through one of those with</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>With kind of the whole live activities dynamic island side of things it felt like you got like into a frenzy of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Coming up with ideas and tweeting about it and getting a bunch of feedback and then getting those ideas in there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and it was really fun to watch from the outside.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm curious what your experience was with that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the whole iOS 16 really cycle.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I feel like that one was some pretty ideal timing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I just released Time of Support,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which was one of those features where I'd just been</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>working on for ages and,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause I work on it mostly in my spare time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'd had, I guess, two kids over the last couple years</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and was just not having the same evening time to work on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I had this feature which I was working on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>trying to get time to support out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I think like maybe a month before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I always 16 or before like the dynamic island anyway,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I got that out the door.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so once they showed the dynamic island at the keynote</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it was almost like straightaway like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>"Oh, this is like perfect because one of the big problems</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with timer apps."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>The system time is great because it gets priority</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in the system.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So when it goes off, you get, you know that's going off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause it makes the noise and vibrates.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But as the third party app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>all you can do is send a notification</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and the user has to go back to the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to see what's happening.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so with live activities, then you have an opportunity</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to kind of break free from those bounds.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And you can actually show the user</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that they've got a timer going and how long's left</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and then you can't do as much when the timer's finished.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But I think it's still, yeah, that whole experience of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>yeah, you've got something running in the background</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and being able to present it to the user outside of the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was pretty awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And yeah, perfect timing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so yeah, pretty much as soon as the keynote finished,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'd quickly like mocked up what I thought was going</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>look like because I just fit like, I don't know, something about the, the, the bounce</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the animations just like got to me. I was like, I need to of the dynamic island to sell.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think with live activities, I probably would have taken it a bit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>slower, but the dynamic island, I don't know something about it. Just, I mean, you got</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:05.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>everybody. It was one of those, it was one of those features where watching it in the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:10.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>keynote, you're like, oh man, they did it like, they really knocked this out of the park.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think it's similar to like the iPad cursor support</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>where you were just like, whoa,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>this is different in a way that Apple's different on things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but also it feels like they nailed it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in a way where sometimes they're just annoying</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with being different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I think I made like some audible noises</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when it, like that sort of interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, so I mopped up what I thought that could look like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I hadn't even released the APIs at that point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So it wasn't really clear what you were gonna be able to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:38.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it just kind of took a stab at it based on what they'd shown.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then once the APIs came out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I kind of just got stuck in to try and see what it would look like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And there was quite a fun experience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then when I tweeted about it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>there was a lot of sort of engagement and interest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in the feature, which I think always helps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when you get by and from other people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You're like, oh, yeah, I should keep going with this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because people are going to use it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, 'cause you were kind of one of the early developers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>who jumped on it that kind of got a lot of people's attention,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like, oh man, look at what this thing can be.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, that was one of those times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when I kind of actually hadn't really thought</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>through what I was posting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just did like a quick screen recording of it working</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and kind of throw it up thinking like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>oh, you know, people might like to see this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then it did surprisingly well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I think like Mike Stern from Apple retweeted it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which was pretty cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And yeah, it got a lot of interest,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>which just yeah, helps with motivation</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and keeping going.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So then between when that was announced</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when they launched 16.1,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I was pretty flat out just trying to get it working.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And there's a bunch of complications</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and the way the API works that you have to work around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So there's a lot of like back and forths</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and trying to figure out how to get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>like the constraints of the layout.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess are quite different to a normal UI view.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So you're just trying to work out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>how to build what you want within quite a constraint system</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was a good challenge.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Now do you feel like that excitement</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and engagement you're getting pre-released</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>did that translate into anything post release?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like, do you think you got more write-ups included</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in some lists or anything from Apple</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and did that make any impact on sales?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, I guess it's hard to know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>whether the build up before the launch was well-caused.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think one of the main things was I was fortunate enough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to get featured in some of Apple's lists</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for the live activity support.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so, and in a few countries,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it was quite high up on the list, which was awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so I think that was maybe with other publications</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and sites were looking to sort of build this stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Right, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And so, yeah, it's pretty awesome being able to kind of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't know, you make like a splash across the internet</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess where you're just like popping up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in a bunch of different places.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's definitely from that was the pretty significant spike</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>in downloads and revenue.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So yeah, I think it was really made it worthwhile</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>'cause I put quite a lot into it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I was sort of before release day</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>was kind of just worried like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>"Oh, maybe I've done all of this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and no one's going to notice or it's not going to be that useful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so it was validating, I guess, to, I guess,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>yeah, see it land pretty well and get some good feedback on it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and also get, I don't know, it's always nice to get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>a little revenue bump from those kind of things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So yeah, it was really cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, no, that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>This is an aside.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I didn't want to interrupt that conversation,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but if anybody at Apple's listening,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>these complaints about the alarms not working correctly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I just have to put this out in the world</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because at least once a week my wife brings this up to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that I need to put this out into the world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>We need an alarm kit, like some sort of way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for developers to make alarms that are not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:49.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the Apple alarm app because they're really problematic</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for people who rely on them for their job.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>My wife is one of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>She has like all these alarms that are very important</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>for the work that she does when she has a day off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or something like that, she can't just hit a button</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to say turn off my alarm, my weak leo arms or anything like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I know there's, and trust me, I've brought them up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>There's like shortcuts you could build to try and make this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But like, this is the exact type of thing that I,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>or somebody should be able to build an app that's like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>a nice wrapper around the system alarms.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And I'm sure it's not the most important problem</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Apple has, but it would be really, really nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- It would be awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>If you could see them to like home pods as well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>if you could create a timer and have it like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>ring on a home pod, that would be,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that was the kind of stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>when I was building out the time of feature.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's like, this is great, but yeah,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>as soon as you leave the app, it's kind of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>not as useful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So yeah, if you could send something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to like a home pod or have it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>once it's finished respond the same way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>the system responds, yeah, that would be awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- And I get, that's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's like a huge undertaking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because of all the bad actors that you'd have to work around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like it'd be like notifications, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Where you have to give people the power to turn them off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because you know Uber is gonna be somehow sending you ads</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>through alarms, like that's the inevitable thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that's gonna happen with any--</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, your phone would just be like a grenade</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that just could go off at any time with its siren.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, 'cause alarms can break out of the silence feature.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I get, it's just like a sacred cow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and that's probably more important than anything,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but just throwing that out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>If you're looking for ideas for iOS 17,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>we'll take it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Just looking at an empty whiteboard,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>We got nothing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Here we go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It'll make at least one developer very happy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- That's right, yeah, there'll be two of us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Is there anything else you wanna talk about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with crew-ton and the other fun, interesting,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>secret stories you wanna put out into the world?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Secret stories, goodness.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't think so. (laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>No worries.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't normally ask people that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't know why I went with that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but-- - I wish I did have a secret story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I feel like that would be quite a good like no to end on like this one time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You can just make something up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's even more pressure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'll come up as soon as this cools ended up like I should have said that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:04.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Perfect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like, yeah, I just wanted to make sure that when you go to bed tonight, um,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>instead of sleeping, you can just rehash that question over and over and keep</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>coming up with better answers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You can guarantee that I'll be replaying this whole conversation.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:18.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's that's really the goal here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Uh, just to make people as uncomfortable as possible.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:28.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Oh man, you just make sure not to pitch that to them before they agree to come on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:34.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, no, no, that's something once you get them stuck on a call that they can escape</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>then you let it out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You can just know enjoyment.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Right, right, exactly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess we can go ahead and wrap things up before we do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'll ask you the question I ask everybody, which is what's a person or people out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that have inspired you that you'd recommend others check out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, so I think I'm gonna I've got three I think three recommendations</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I'm the first one I've already mentioned was Daniel goes here with up a head and I bother</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:06.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think if you use crouton you can definitely see that there's some inspiration there and yeah his ex just have a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:11.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Degree of polish that is quite rare these days and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:17.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>He's also yeah, really great on Twitter as well. Just I don't know keeps the feet a bit more lighthearted</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, recently, and there's a little bit of cross</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>pollination here because I interviewed him</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and his episode will be coming out as we record tomorrow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So yeah, go listen to the one before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that's the thing I'm supposed to say, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like organic growth or something like that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:35.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Oh, it's plug.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(laughs)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Take a recommendation is Ryan Ashcroft,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>who you have had on as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Definitely around those early sort of days</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with crewton, a lot of the work he was doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>with the scanning, the nutrition labels,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and also just the way that he kind of marketed food</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>norms as well was really like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>definitely inspired me with a lot of the things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I've done on Krujon.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:02.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Last one was Kyle Hughes, who I think is just a great follow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>on Twitter as well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Again, if you're just wanting something to make the feed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>a bit more exciting, his tweets are always so,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I don't know if he's crafting them,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but they feel so well crafted and so just on the point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>every time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And he also has a few apps as well that are really nice</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>just in how simple they are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So I definitely recommend checking out some of his stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Kyle's somehow both nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like he's not like one of these like incendiary,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Twitter commentators.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But then somehow it feels like he's like making fun</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>of just corporate developer life in an incredibly effective way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>without it punching down ever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Very, very entertaining.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I can't tell you how many of his tweets I end up sharing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>to friends because they make me laugh so much.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Definitely, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Thank you again for coming on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>This has been really fun watching crewton grow</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>kind of over the last couple of years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I guess I didn't mention it, but like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>it's kind of taken over mine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like I said, we were paprika users for forever</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because all my data was sitting in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's what the family used</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and it's hard to kind of switch people over.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And then I ended up trying a whole bunch of them</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>because I just wanted to try something that was a little more modern.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Like you had mentioned, I've been playing with Krutan for a while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and it just makes me happy to use and finally I'm like, "You know what?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's it. That's why do I find it?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Finally, when you have an iCloud syncing and all that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>I think that was part of the thing originally was you didn't have iCloud syncing, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Or not iCloud family sharing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:40.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And so all the pieces were in place and so it's been my go-to for a little bit now and it's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:46.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It makes me really happy to know the person who's made the thing that I'm using all the time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So, thank you so much for coming on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>It's been great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>So where can people find you and your work?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>That's a good question because at the time of recording you can find me on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>But when this goes out, who knows what you'll be able to find me?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>And Christchurch New Zealand for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>Yeah, that's how long I've established that's the place to go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>You can find me on Twitter with the handle just me, Diven, at the moment.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>and hopefully for a long time into the future,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but we'll see what happens.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Do you have a website or something just in case?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>We don't have that answer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- I did start a blog recently,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>two minute noodles,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Two minute noodles.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- You can find me there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>but it probably won't be the most interesting thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>that you'll look up, but I will be there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>- Perfect.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line"></p>(upbeat music)</p>
