<p class="time-stamp">00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to Launched. I'm Charlie Chapman, and today I'm excited to bring you the developer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">behind the downtime organizer, Sofa, Sean Hickman.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sean, welcome to the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thank you for having me, Charlie.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very happy to be here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very honored to be here, actually.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of funny.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Normally, you know, this is an opportunity to see somebody for the first time or maybe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've seen their face on Twitter or something like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But because of the stuff you do on YouTube that we'll get to later, I feel like I'm familiar</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with your office layout.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I know where you're at and positioned to your space in a way that I don't normally</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">already have sort of pre-baked in my mind.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I'm always, I like ran out the office a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like I need a plant in the back somewhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">People on YouTube have plants,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and every time I see one I go,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, that's a good looking plant, it's nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And you need two contrasting like LED lights,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like a pink and a blue or a green and an orange</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's how you know you're like a tech YouTuber.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, you have some kind of RGB light,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that kind of stuff, 100%.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Really shallow depth of field.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, blur out the background.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You don't even wanna see the background at all, just blur.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The perfect podcast content is when you talk about stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that nobody listening can see.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Since you can see it, I will point out here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've got a couple green plants here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">literally got those for Christmas,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">took them out of the box and put them there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so that I don't have a pile of boxes in our house.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know how you do with Christmas stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's the extent of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So not super organized over here yet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but there is some green showing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Your plant game is way better than mine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, they exist, so I guess I have that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So, props to you, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- All right, well, before we get into Sofa</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and your YouTube channel eventually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and all the stuff you do,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I wanna give everyone an introduction to who you are,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other than the lack of your plant background.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, the three questions I always ask everybody</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kick things off here is, where are you from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then we can talk about your career leading up to SOFA.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sure, so I am from suburbs outside of Philly,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">specifically a township called Delco or Delaware County.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's why my voice sounds like this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which, you know, that'll probably come up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It comes up a lot with people who are not from the area</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and even from the area.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I wanna interject,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause you said this before we started recording.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You said, "I'm from a specific suburb,"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's where the accent comes from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So this is like, it's not a Philly thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a specific area, or well, outside of Philadelphia?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so from what I understand,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at some point there was like a large migration</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of people from South Philly into the suburbs,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and a lot of them made up what is now Delaware County.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And you say, "Oh, Delaware County, it's in Delaware."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you go, no, it's in Pennsylvania.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's called Delco for short,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's actually been made fun of on SNL and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of made its way into pop culture a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, but we're oddly known for the way we pronounce words</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and stuff like that, so, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You're holding on to the regional accent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like most of those are waning away in America.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I'm representing Delco today, yeah, 100%.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, there you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so Delco.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the next thing would be like formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so formal education.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I went to college for graphic design.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm professionally a designer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was back in 2007</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I graduated graphic design.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was like advertising focused.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, people would say,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, what do you do with graphic design?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I would always be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, I make like CD covers," right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is, you know, hilarious now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When I graduated, that's the year that the iPhone came out,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the first iPhone, and I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, like, I wanna do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I had no idea what that even was.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just wanted to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You wanted to make CoverFlow images, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I wanna make all the album artwork for CoverFlow,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, you know, formerly trained as a graphic designer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then over time got into software, UX, UI,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all that kind of stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you know, eventually writing, writing apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so after, so career leading up to this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so school, I did an internship at the end of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like towards the end of my schooling,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it was with like an advertising thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">we were making, they made like credit card mailers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Ooh, that sounds exciting and fulfilling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And I remember just feeling so much regret,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, what did I choose for my career?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, is this what I'm going to be doing forever?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I was just like, I can't do this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My first, my first job out of college or actually internship was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">an insurance claims processing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, well, there you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Similar level of excitement and fulfillment.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm surprised you're not still doing it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Isn't it so much fun?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Well, you know, you can only handle so much of the heat, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, it's, it's, it's a really intense area, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you can't, if you can't handle the game, you got to get out, you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know, that's what it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I said, like the, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the iPhone was announced towards the end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So then I started trying to get mobile design jobs.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, oh, I can, I'll do mobile design.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But everywhere would say, well, you need like four</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to five years of experience designing for mobile.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then I would say, well, the iPhone just came out.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how is that even possible?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, how would anyone have that experience?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Unless you were designing for like Blackberry or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, Windows Mobile, you weren't all over that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Ah, yeah, that's right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 'Cause it had like the start menu</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at the bottom and everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah. - Like that, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did have a Palm Trio back in the day too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, which I liked quite a bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now I work as a design manager</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at a design firm in Philly called Think Company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, I've been there for the past eight years.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Nice, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And how, like, were you doing indie stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on the side this whole time?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or was Sofa kind of your first play in that space?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sofa has like a longer story than people probably know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So when I was at QVC,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You should do a podcast about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I should do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you know anyone I could do that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll ask around.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, yeah, I gotta find someone.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, so, uh, at QVC, I met two, two coworkers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, one was, uh, uh, they were both developers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One was, uh, iOS, one was a web developer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hit it off and we actually, you know, got together and made</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the first version of Sofa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This was back in 2015.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the very first version was like only movies, like you could only add movies to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was very discovery focused.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, we would like curate these lists of movies that you could, you know, watch and then like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you could add them to a list if you want to watch them later.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Was the whole database, like, did you enter everything in or were you using something like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was it the movie database?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, the movie, yeah, the movie database was our, you know, main data source.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then we built just like a little CMS and our own little like API layer over that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to power the like curated list that we put together. So that was 2015. And then, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">life got busy for everybody. I'm still very good friends with both of those guys. But I wanted to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">keep going with it. Like I had more ideas and I was like, "Oh, I think there's something here."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I said, "All right, well, I'll figure it out. Like I'll learn iOS development and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">build an app, right? Like, how hard could it be? Right? Famous last words. It was very hard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in 2017, I launched like, Sofa 2.0, which was like, completely different app from the original</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and very, very simple. Like, you know, it was like a baby app at first.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Was it more simple than the 1.0 version?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:31.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, interesting. Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it was literally just like, you can make lists and then you can put either movies or TV</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">shows into those lists. That's it. Like it was, and it was almost like a to-do list. You could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like check stuff off. I like reached out to someone in the press to like, "Hey, would you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like to write a review about this?" And they very kindly said, "Your app's maybe a little too basic</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at this point. Maybe reach out when it's, you know, when it's a little more fleshed out." And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like, "That was a very nice way to say no."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. And ever since 2017, just been iterating on it ever since.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Wow. So, was the first version, like, let's see, 2017, was it paid up front or did you have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">subscriptions at that point already?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:21.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No. So, subscriptions, I only recently introduced in July of 2021. So, originally, it was just free.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because to be honest, I was like, "This is not good enough for anyone to pay for."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:33.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So after a little bit, I actually did change it to a paid app. So it was then $4.99. I think I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">made like a hundred bucks or something over a couple months. What was your aspiration?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Were you thinking this will eventually be something that I'll make paid before you switch</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it to paid? Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay. So the idea was I'll build this up to something at some point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. I've always wanted it to be a full-time business and all that stuff. And it's moving</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">towards that direction, which is great, but it's I've obviously like I had a very meandering</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">journey on the way there. Man, that's fascinating. Okay, so trying to think so this is it's been</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">around for a while, but I feel like what you're describing and what I think of as SOFA, or at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">least when it came on my radar, very different thing. So like, I guess just kind of walk us</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">through that journey to get up to there, like subscription or like business model changes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:27.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but also just how you added on to it in terms of finding areas of value from people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:34.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. So, first released in 2017, Sofa 2.0 was free. And then I forget when I changed it to a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">paid app when it was $4.99, maybe like a year later or something like that. And at that point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'd add it. You can add like podcasts to it. You can add books to it. So, there was more things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:53.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there. And where was that coming from? Was that like you had sort of a road map in your head or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">these are things you found yourself wanting or were you getting feedback from people and that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:03.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was sort of driving what features you added? Back in December of 2022 I released uh I'm going to be</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:10.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">jumping all over the place Charlie. Oh yeah. Just FYI. Yeah uh so in uh last December of 2022 I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I released Sofa 3.4 and I was like, there's features in that version that I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have been wanting since 2017, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you can have shared lists with like your spouse or your friend or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And right now it's like, it's a beta feature.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, cause there's, there's some iOS 16 quirkiness to, uh, iron out there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's that there's shortcut support.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's, there's a couple of things that I feel like it's at a point where</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it, the foundation is there and now I can really start iterating on like the core product</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in new ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, interesting. So, it's almost like the sort of vision you have in your head</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is really only recently fully realized and now you're at that point of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how do you build on top of that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's how I feel about it. You know, a lot of stuff is, you know, you go down some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">directions and you're like, "Oh, that didn't work." Feedback from people, I would, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people, co-workers and stuff who would use it, who were very generous with their time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I remember when I was doing the paid app, it was $4.99, and I was telling my uncle about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's like, "Oh, that sounds really cool." Like, I was just explaining the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:30.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I literally watched him go to the app store and he's like, "$4.99?" He's like, "I don't pay</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for apps. I was like, bro, are you serious? Oh, I've run into this a lot. You're my uncle.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What the hell? Yeah. So, um, and I was like, wow, if I can't get my uncle to pay for this, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:48.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what shot do I have here? So that's when, um, I actually then made the app free again,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all over the place. Right. And actually, uh, so in 2020, I, I added themes, like custom themes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and stuff like that. And I started selling themes individually, thinking like, "Oh, okay,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like maybe I make a bunch of different themes. They're really, really nice or just like quirky</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in different ways." People will buy them and they'll be like a dollar or two dollars or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something like that. And that with enough volume, that would be, that would be okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the, like filters or something for camera apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've heard you talk about the, almost like the hesitancy of like charging for stuff. And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">When I look back, I'm like, "Oh, I think I was just scared to do subscription and I should have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">done it." You know? Like, that was the obvious decision that I was just like afraid to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, "Well, I'll try this other thing first and then, you know, and then I'll change it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:50.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if it doesn't work." So, yeah. And then in 2021, July of 2021, Sofa3.0 came out with the subscription</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to Super Sofa, which is like the pro version. - Which is a fantastic name, by the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, thanks man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I feel like it's hard to come up with a,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I went through this a lot 'cause I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't wanna just slap pro at the end or plus at the end</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because that's what everybody does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But what I realized is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's really hard to come up with a cutesy name</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's also very clear and obvious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that this is a pro version of it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But super is almost, it has the same connotation,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it works so well with sofa</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I feel like you kind of pulled it off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having a sort of cutesy unique name that's also clear.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, well, that's good to hear.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I wonder if like some of it is too cute.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like the first time you go to Starbucks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you say, "Oh, can I get a large coffee?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they go, "You want a venti?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you go, "I don't know, is that a large?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"I'll take that."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You just kind of roll your eyes like, "Ugh."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, you're like, you have to like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know the language, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it's like a fine line between that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and it is tricky.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like, I feel like there's a reason everybody,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's kind of like all the TV subscription apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being plus now at the end.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like-- - Everything's plus.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's easy to make fun of it, but also,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's a real, like, when you're in the position</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of naming something or marketing something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you go, oh, there's a very, very small number</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of characters thing I can slap on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that is immediately understood by everybody.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, that's a golden goose that's really hard to replace.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 100%, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if I was doing the Super Sofa stuff today, like net new,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I may call it sofa plus, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, just to lean into that more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, super sofa I think is, it's fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's fun to say for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's the point of the app too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I think like it's to be fun, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But sometimes I think like, oh, I should come up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with like an even better version</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that is like super duper sofa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Hmm.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- You know, but then that just gets like really stupid.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I probably won't do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So you've mentioned a couple of times getting feedback</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from people and like.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at your suite of things that you have now, I feel like, like, I know you have a discord and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a community, a whole community page in your website. And it's kind of like a concept</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you seem to really be leaning into, but I'm assuming you didn't have that, uh, whenever you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">had an app that was, you know, just one list that you could add to. So like, how did, what was sort</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of the journey to get to where you are now? And why do you have so much stuff around that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Dude, community stuff is hard. Like, I don't even know how to explain this, but I'm not like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:29.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not good at participating in communities. I'm good at lurking in communities.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Even like on Twitter, or, you know, like I'm on Massadown now, like we all are.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">My natural reaction is to not say anything and not post ever. It's just to like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">watch other people, right? And just kind of like absorb it. So, it actually takes a lot of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">effort and energy to even write anything on these platforms. But</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:16:52.280 --> 00:17:03.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's like things where I've been inspired by certain products that have just done it well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and maybe it's just like kinda luck how it happens, but like the App Obsidian,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like their Discord community is, and even their forums are just wild.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:21.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So good. Just so much great information. People are just, they just like are obsessed with Obsidian.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's definitely one of those cult type projects.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:24.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">100%.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or Notion is similar.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Notion, yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I almost said Rome and then I realized I'm just listing all of the...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The PKM stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah. All the, what is that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">PKM, Personal Knowledge Management.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, there you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm mailing myself as a nerd in that way. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so stuff like that. I'm just like, oh, it's great because when you're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Getting into a product like that yourself, which you're like, oh, is this any good?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:58.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The community is like a feature of it really for sure because you get to learn how other people set stuff up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You can reach out for help all that kind of stuff. So</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you think about from um,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hey, i'm one person like, you know, like being an indie developer. You kind of need all the help you can get</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there's a lot of, I think, just mutual benefit to having a closer connection and,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, line of communication between yourself and people who either use the product or just fans of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:32.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it for getting feedback, for helping other people. Like, you know, ideally, if things go well, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey, they can help with, like, support. Because someone asks a question and it's like, well,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe someone else jumps in and answers, right? Like maybe I can't get to it right away or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something. But also like they have a hand in I think shaping the product at this point</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:53.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too because I'm trying to post more as I'm working, which again is very unnatural,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feels very uncomfortable, but I'm trying to do it more. And it actually is nice because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">stuff I'm working on where it's just like, you know, like you have an idea and you're just kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like riffing on it and then someone points something out and you go, "Oh yeah, that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">actually a good point. Like I'll fix that, right? I'll do it in real time." And you do it before</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you ship anything and those people have a hand in actually making the product better, which I think,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">again, it's just like a nice little mutual ecosystem if it all goes well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm always so jealous of thinking of indies, I think of like drafts or even like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Christian Selig with Apollo. Yeah. I feel like most apps that can pull it off. It's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:44.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of like the creative, productive, like, life hacky. That's not the right term. I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know what the right term is. Well, maybe it's the acronym you said a minute ago, but...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">PKM.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">PKM. It's all about the PKM.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Get in there, man. Get in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:58.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, it's hard to have it. I feel like it's only certain niches of apps that can kind of have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have that, I guess Apollo is not that at all, but it's a Reddit app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it makes sense that yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A network built around communities would also form a good community, but like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's so many benefits if you can pull that off.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I imagine it's also, there's also some trickiness to it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, like, do you find yourself having to do moderation or I guess I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">know what size you're dealing with, but.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's small right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like the discord server has like, I think less than a hundred people in it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Very manageable at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I'm worried about it too, to be honest with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I had a, I actually had a, I set up a forum,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Discourse Forum, and also, can we talk about the names</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of these products?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Discourse and Discord, like who did this?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Mm, yeah, that's a little too close, isn't it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, very confusing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, Discourse is the forum stuff,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I actually had that set up like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you would go to like forum.sofahq.com,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I ran that for like a year,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was just like too much work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I shut it down at the beginning of 2022</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it was just, I still have a full-time job,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm doing this on the side.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I have to be very picky with where I'm putting my time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it was just taking up too much of my time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to kind of check and all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I was paying for it too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It was just, you know, it was like a hosted thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I set up a Reddit whenever I first made Dark Noise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And actually I think it's still out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and there's even a link to it in the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like every once in a while,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">somebody will post in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And for the longest time,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't know of a way to get notifications on that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I got out of the habit of checking it because,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, and then I'd go there and there'd be like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">other people would answer the question,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but then somebody would ask something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and there'd just be nothing for like two months.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'd be like, oh my gosh, I can't believe.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I did find out, IFTTT, wow, I can't remember.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I don't remember what it stands for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, I'll look at the show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If this, then that, thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- PKM is what you're thinking of.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Struggling with the acronyms tonight.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there is a way with that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I could set up some sort of notification.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Actually, you know what?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now Apollo, which we just mentioned, the Reddit app,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it has notifications on subreddits that you can set up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think-- - I did not realize.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Maybe it's just with Apollo Ultra, I'm not sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you don't have it and you use Reddit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">pay for it. No, no, I worth it. Yeah, it's good. I use Apollo every day. I love it. I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably sound like a moron. I didn't know. I didn't know you could set up the notifications</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for like, not knowing a feature that's in Apollo is definitely a forgivable offense because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's fair. Thank you. A billion of them. I needed that. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Very kind.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Christian, I'll send you my invoice for your accidental ad later today. But yes, Apollo,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">go get it. It definitely is a thing that you have to keep up with or it can turn on you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's especially true with just support in general. Actually, maybe this is a little</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">rabbit hole we can go down because we're recording at night. So you're getting unstructured, Charlie.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:11.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do you deal with support? I've noticed your website is one beautiful, but two,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:19.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">has a lot of things regarding frequently asked questions and support and community features.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How do you manage that? Because I have been spectacularly failing with dark</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">noise with keeping up with email and I don't know what to do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:26.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Since I don't have, it's not my full-time job and I can't say,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I spend four hours every Friday morning or something on it. I don't know how to deal with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:40.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It can be a lot of times. What I do that is, so what's helped me is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:49.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I get a question from someone via email, it's pretty common that, or it's pretty likely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that someone else is going to have that question. So, what I will do is I will set aside 15 minutes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:04.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just write that up as like, you know, a support document on the website. And then I will just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Here's the link." Right? Like, "Oh, I have an answer to that. Here's the link." I can't tell</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:16.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you how much time it saved long-term to take 10 to 15 minutes, write up the support page,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:23.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then the number of times I shared just the link instead of rewriting it is it's it's wild. It's like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Every time I go i'm so glad I did this, you know in the moment</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's it's easy. It's easy to just like not do it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's times i'm like, I don't feel like doing this, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:40.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But i've been saved so many times by it that it's just worth it. It's like i'm asking a you know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">102 year old man. How did you do it? How did you stay so healthy and they're like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:51.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I ate my vegetables and took a walk every day. Like it's like, Oh, right. Yes, there is an easy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">answer to this. And I'm just not doing the hard thing once. And instead, I'm taking the lazy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">approach. But yes, we'll just say that that was an aside for the sake of the audience.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So they could hear that advice. And not because I have not been doing that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Easy, just said and done. And but yeah, there's I mean, you know, like, there's,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's periods where like the email support just like gets a little too high.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's the thing. And that's what happens to me is where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you get overwhelmed with it. And then it's like, well, I can't stop and focus on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">getting this support stuff all written and built up because I'm trying to get through all these</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">emails. And then the emails go away and then you stop, you know, focusing on that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think it's just like a forever struggle to just, you know, do your best.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you use, do you just use like normal email or do you have some kind of help triage</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">system or service or something?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I just do it the dumb way. I just have like an email address that people and it just comes in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I go, "All right, I'll answer this email now." You know, so yeah, I know there are better tools</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:06.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out there, but I, part of me kind of likes the, just the like, yeah, it's just email.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's just really simple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't, I don't mind it to be honest with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">To kind of pull back into a normal show here, we, we already talked about the fact that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you did switch over to subscriptions, but we haven't talked about how that actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, so one, the switch itself, but then also how has that like impacted the business?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, it's been great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:40.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, so it's been a year and a half since, uh, subscriptions have launched and I'm</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, man, I wish I did it sooner.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, so, so good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's, it's scary at first.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause you're like, all right, like I'm asking for real money here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:58.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And, and I get feedback from, uh, from people, this is not very frequent, but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you can even see on the app store page, this is too expensive, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is too expensive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:10.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think compared to other apps, like a personal plan for the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">year is 35 bucks for the year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And, uh, if you compare that to Apollo, which is like, I think it's like 10 bucks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a year, it's like super cheap.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think he's under, he's, he's underpriced.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's got scale too, though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, I mean, I don't want to say anything about his business necessarily,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">cause I don't have inside knowledge, but, uh, it's definitely, he's definitely</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">playing on a different, you know, stratosphere, I feel like in a lot of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:36.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">different ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like I'll hear that feedback and stuff, but like the growth over the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">past year and a half has been really great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:55.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm, I'm not picking up on any signs that like it's overpriced.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If things are growing, plenty of people are very happy to pay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And, uh, yeah, I would, so in, uh, I did like a 20, 22 year and a few video.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in that, I was like, I was, I was talking to my wife and I was like, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">don't know what to share here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I am not comfortable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, I was taught growing up, like, you don't talk about money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Don't do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's rude.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:22.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's weird.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like not comfortable like sharing numbers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, in that video, I was like, "Okay, what can I share that I am comfortable with or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">kind of comfortable with?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that was just like year over year growth.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you like, you did a good job of prepending that with, "I know," like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you don't know what the initial numbers are, like...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">100%.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:42.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought that was great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's my comfort level at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I also know that like, as like indie developers, information, that kind of information</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:02.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is really helpful for us. So, I feel a mix of like guilt by not like giving back to like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">community that I've learned a ton from and have benefited from. But I'm also like, I don't know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">man. It's my -- it's like financial stuff. And that's, I don't know, that's pretty private. So...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:18.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's it's a weird it's a really weird subject in part because of the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, like companies are always like don't talk to other employees about how</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">much you pay or how much you're paid, which of course they're not supposed to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do and there's that angle of it, but then they do anyway.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:29.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there's you know, there's a bunch of weird financial things, but even even</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you like I especially because you know, my stuff all started really small.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't have any qualms about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'd watched, I've talked about this on the show before,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I'd watched Jordan Morgan be extremely open</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and thought that was helpful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I was like, oh, I'll just do the same thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But like, since Dark Noise has grown some,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and in my opinion has grown despite me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the lack of time and skill or whatever you wanna say</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I was able to put towards it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there is an element even once you've accepted,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I'm just gonna share everything,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you start feeling guilty sharing everything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause you're like, am I giving a false pretense to somebody?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I got super lucky and somebody could do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all the same things as me and the numbers are way lower</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and am I actually making it worse by putting this out there?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think it's just like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">saying anything publicly is uncomfortable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Correct.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And so saying things or not saying things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, I think there's pros and cons to anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So everybody has to come to what they're comfortable with.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But, but even if you share everything, it's not like, uh, now you feel like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're, you know, on top of the world and whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's, it's, it's a weird topic, but when people do it, I, I love it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm like, oh, this is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm learning.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's, that's where like my guilt comes from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause I feel like I'm withholding, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, because what you're doing, uh, and I, we can just go ahead and jump into this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have a whole topic on different marketing things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but one of the marketing things that you've done is you have a YouTube</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">channel, but it's not like just,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here's the features of sofa or here's how you can do a power user thing and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sofa. It's also like, here's a behind the scenes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Look at how I created my press kit. Like that's literally,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you have a video about that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is obviously not just for you selling copies of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of sofa it's it's for the community.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like that kind of stuff is arguably a lot more beneficial even.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Where did that all kind of come from?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, I mean, I watch a lot of YouTube, like an unhealthy amount, maybe, but it's great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:53.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, I mean, I, I mean, so many people say it's like just the things you can learn</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on YouTube, it's just unbelievable.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Most of the things I've learned about iOS development, I learned on YouTube.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's, it's just so good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:09.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And um, one of the things I there's like, um, photography is a hobby of mine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:18.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that whole like area of YouTube is very interesting because they do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">tons of behind the scenes stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like, like one of the things I love watching, which is, it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">going to sound really weird, but I love watching behind the scenes videos</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of photographers at weddings.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because to me, it's something I would never wanna do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because the stress.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It just seems like, don't screw this up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's one shot here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they just kill it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They just do so well.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they're also like shooting behind the scenes stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as they're, you know, doing this person's wedding.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it's such a great way to learn too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like as if, you know, to learn photography.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then there's this also,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they POV videos of photographers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They like hook a GoPro up to their chest</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then like walk around and take pictures.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:07.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's such a great way to learn how they take pictures,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like how they frame stuff, what their settings are,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what they're seeing, what they're not seeing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that kind of stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so bringing that back to SOFA,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I'm doing stuff all the time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I have the website, I make a press kit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, we talked about like support pages</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:30.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">stuff like that. I think, I actually think there's an overabundance of content for indie</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developers around code, right? Which is great. I don't need to contribute to that, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because my code ain't going to help anybody, right? Like, there are way better people for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:47.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But when it comes to like, kind of your kind of product infrastructure, right? And how you do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:54.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things and how you can scale yourself to be a little bit bigger than just one person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:33:54.260 --> 00:34:02.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think that stuff's really interesting. And I'm like, "Oh, I have ideas and opinions here</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I think are worth sharing and people can learn from." Like, you can take, just take a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">little nugget that you like from the video and use it. You know, that's fine. You don't have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to use the whole thing. - Yeah. I mean, that's the thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of like, it's like getting to work with somebody.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:22.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">In the sense that, like, so much of what I know how to do professionally is because I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">worked with people, at least I used to work with people in the same space, and you just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">see how they do things and like, hear people's thought processes as you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:35.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And especially in the indie scene, but even on top of that, in the like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:42.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">indie marketing, running a business, whatever you want to call that world,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:49.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Most of us are doing that much more insular from the world, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like Twitter was pretty much the only space where I feel like I ever saw</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:00.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that kind of stuff really talked about. Like a press kit. People might talk about it there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:06.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I feel like your video, I got like a dozen things from that. I literally have some notes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from when I watched that one where I'm like, "Ooh!" Or not notes, but I threw it into my</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feedback for me. Yeah. I mean, like the idea of using notion, like, of course, I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:21.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">knew that that's a thing you could do. And when I first, like, when you first</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">brought up that you use notion for your press kit, I was like, Oh, that's kind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of a clever idea. But like, I have a system that kind of works well for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then there was a couple more things that you said, where I was like, Hmm,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">maybe I should really consider that. And then by the end of it, I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">alright, I'm adding a task to research. So like, what would it be like to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">switch this over to notion or craft or one of those.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Hmm, yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Because it solved a couple little problems</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it's like, I knew that existed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because people have talked about stuff like that on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But watching you and hearing you talk through</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">why you did it is a big part of, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what sort of got my brain chugging on that idea.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I love that kind of stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's cool, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, I've ideas for tons more videos like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I never want to be like preachy with stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, it just more like, Hey, this is what I did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Here's why I did it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if, if it's helpful for you, great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, cause you know, everyone's situation's different and it may not be a one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to one match for, uh, for what people need.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, but I do think that, um, you might say like, okay, that stuff's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">great for like developers and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think people are just interested though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like people use apps all the time, but they have no clue where it comes from.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They don't know who makes them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They don't know what's involved.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:48.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think like one of my long-term ideas with the YouTube stuff, because the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">YouTube channel is like crazy small, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's, and that's totally fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the long-term idea is that, okay, I'm, you know, I'm asking people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to pay real money for this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They have no idea who I am and they may not even know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They may think like, we hear the joke all the time, like everyone thinks just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Apple makes all the apps, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:08.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:18.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I have intentionally and uncomfortably put my face in, in different parts of the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:25.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">app and like the marketing stuff, uh, and with the YouTube channel more as a way to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">show that, like, there's like a real person here and it's not just like some big</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">companies just trying to like cash grab stuff and look at all the work that I do for this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:43.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like this is, this takes time. This takes a lot of effort and I mean, gang, 35 bucks a year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:51.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is not expensive. I'm sorry. It's just not. Like it's not. So, you know, that's a hill I will die</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:59.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on. Yeah, it's interesting like, because I do the same kind of thing. I feel like I, a lot of my</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:04.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">support requests, and even reviews a lot of times will literally call me up by name.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They'll be like, "Hey, Charlie," or "Charlie's a great..." whatever,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is awesome when it's positive.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:19.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I always wonder... I've talked to a lot of people on this show about this exact thing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where it's like, there's a point... Whenever you're doing a thing on the side in our community,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">most people using it at first are probably going to be other people in our community,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because that's who you reach, right? But if you start getting traction on the store,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:39.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the majority of people that are downloading your app, you got that acquisition through the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">store. There didn't go to your website. They don't know who you are on Twitter. I doubt that they're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:52.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">on your YouTube page. So do you also integrate your face or your name or anything like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in the app itself? Yeah. In the settings page,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if you scroll to bottom, my very beautiful face is there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so your actual face is there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't notice that before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's small enough so that I look better.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, if it was bigger, it wouldn't be horrifying.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah, look at that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, just subtle ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, like, that's also like kind of buried, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like in settings all the way at the bottom, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Which is fine, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm not trying to hit people over the head with this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but for those that are kind of curious, it can be helpful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Most people are probably not gonna care though,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, it's nice whenever that stuff's surrounding</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the parts where they start trying to solve a problem.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you can find the areas where people are frustrated</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and at those points make it more obvious</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it's a single human being behind this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like maybe that helps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. And it's true. Like you just said it, like people say, call you out by name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like, "Oh, hey, Charlie." People do it to me too through support emails. I like that. I think it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">nice, you know? Because like, they know it's me, right? It's not like, "To whom it may concern,"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">right? Kind of thing. Or like, "Dear company." It's like, "Hey, Sean, there's this problem. Can</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you please help me?" So, it's nice. - Yeah. There's definitely a different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">voice in support emails when somebody realizes you're a person.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I also get support emails that'll be like referencing the team or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you all or, you know, words like that where it's like, oh, this person thinks</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm a company company.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then when I respond, I'm a little more, I mean, I'm always pretty personal</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because usually I'm trying to reply on my phone while my kids are brushing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">their teeth or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And like the next reply that you get back, you know, if the person's angry or</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whatever is usually a lot more, uh, human, if that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">A hundred percent.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a great way to diffuse any kind of tension that's there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, I imagine there's arguments for the other way in terms of, especially</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">depending on the type of app that you're building, if, if you want the trust of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">being a company and not an individual, because there's an assumption you make</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whenever you download software and it's like, oh, this is some guy in, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">their mom's basement or whatever making this and you kind of have a idea in your</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">head of what level of support and quality you should get out of this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, but I guess if the app speaks for itself, then by the time they've gotten</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:36.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the point of realizing you're a person, they already know that this is a, an app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the quality that you've already presented.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there's like a, you know, most people don't write in, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there's also like the, there's the selection of folks who actually take</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">time do it, which is awesome. But most people, if they run into an issue or if they have a question,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they probably just like, "I guess I can't figure this out. I guess it's broken." You know? And</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then they just like put it away. I struggled for a long time figuring out how to do your like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my signature at the end of an email that's like a genuine support this person's having trouble,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know? Because it always feels weird saying, "Thanks!" with an exclamation point,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Charlie, salutations felt a little too formal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And what I kind of landed on most of the time is "Thanks for reaching out."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that wording...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:22.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's a good one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">...to that point that you just made of like, "Most people don't reach out."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I want to signal like, "I'm really grateful that you didn't just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bail or leave a bad review. You actually pinged me."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:34.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so that's kind of why, like, probably nobody that gets my emails cares what the signature is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it makes it easier for me to send them now, having that kind of at the end of most of them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:52.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. I've been doing, if it's a Super Sofa subscriber who emails me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll say every time, "Thanks for your support." Every time.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:56.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:02.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, and like, because it's true. Thank you. Like, that's amazing that... Dude, isn't it weird that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you made something and someone bought it like someone</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">freaks me out. Yeah. Yeah. That's I've said that on the</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">show too, but like like when support email gets heavy, which</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm in a phase right now where it's a little heavier. I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">have this feeling admittedly, but there are times where I'll</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:24.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get a support email that like in iOS 16 or in iOS like dot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">update broke something or even an update that I pushed out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">broke something and it'll happen right after one of those</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:36.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">things happen. And my initial feeling is usually not like, "Oh, I gotta go fix this." It's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:41.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Somebody noticed." Like, "There's a human being behind these numbers." You know? Like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, that is actually like a really nice feeling, surprisingly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:55.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, it's amazing. Like, someone cares enough to even like write an email. It's just, it's so nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:03.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Yeah. Even even the I haven't gotten like a super mean one, but the ones that are maybe a little there's a little, uh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:13.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a little aggressiveness behind it, you know, uh, hey, thanks for writing it. That's cool. You know, you care enough to you care enough to get mad. That's cool. You know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:23.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I haven't had to deal with the like the really angry thing, but I'm I'm I'm very girded up for it, uh, preparing for this subscription switch because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:42.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Usually the most, uh, I don't know how to phrase this hostile is not the right word, but like, yeah, the ones that make me feel a little tense, uh, are usually the ones that are like, thank you so much for not being one of the horrible mean, angry, terrible, awful money grabbing developers that uses subscriptions.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm kind of like, "Oh no."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Not yet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(both laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's a threat, isn't it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they're probably not meaning it that way, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But it always feels that way to me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you're gonna come back for me, aren't you?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, they might, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Well, hopefully they won't, 'cause I'm not gonna like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah. - take it away</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">from somebody who's already paid, but.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, how are you doing with all that?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Is that getting close, you think?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And if you don't wanna talk about it, that's fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I'm always afraid I'm gonna like turn this into</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">me talking about my things show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, well, people aren't here for me though.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They're here for you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:23.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, but, uh, but no, I am a decent ways into it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:31.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I, uh, you know, there was a bunch of company, my job, job stuff that all, uh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">all kind of got crazy for a little bit.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was making me really drive on a lot of these things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and so I'm on the other side of that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And now the jobby job's taking a little bit more of my brain power.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I've slowed down a little bit, but my, probably my top priority right now is to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">get that switch taken care of.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Cause it's weighing heavily on my brain.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also I keep hearing things from people like you saying, I just wish I had switched</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it sooner.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like, I'm already, I've already made the decision.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now I just want it to be switched over and to deal with these consequences.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I work very slowly, deliberately is the word I use.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But really what I mean is scared, scaredly.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, yeah, the fear is real.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh my God.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Fear of messing things up of bugs of yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And any of that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm, I'm a very slow developer, but, um, yeah, well, I'm slower than you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's brutal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, sometimes I'm like, when am I even like, how did I make it here?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You know, like how'd I get here?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's crazy how like continually working on something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when you look back, you've traveled forward.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, walking really, really slowly for multiple years</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">still gets you somewhere.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And that's the thing that's been weird with,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think, and maybe you've experienced this too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like by being so public about what I'm working on,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of this natural driver to like get back</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the thing that people in my head know me for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And because of that, even when I'm in like the down times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I'm just not moving or anything,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm still just like plugging away at little tickets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I can pull or little small things I can do.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:28.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then when those iOS 16 or iOS updates come out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or new features or whatever happened,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then I like kind of pull it together</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and get a couple of features all at once.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then yeah, when you look back on it,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're like, you know, I actually did make some stuff, didn't I?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like this is moving forward.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not as stagnant as it feels like in my head.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, just I mean just showing up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like just show up regularly and you'll make progress.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, if it's like little bits at a time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So okay, we're talking about marketing right now.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Man, you're really getting late night Charlie here</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">with the tangents. - Oh, you're good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- So there was a couple of other things</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I did wanna talk about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So we talked about the YouTube channel.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't even know if we talked about why you started.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah, we did.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">We talked a lot about why you started the YouTube channel.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there's a couple other things that you've talked about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">One of them is doing some paid sponsorships advertisements</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for different things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like there was some podcasts that you did last year.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm curious, again, why you chose to do that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then how it went.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so, I mean, marketing is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like I've, you know, this podcast is great</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I've got to hear so many other developers</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">talk about stuff like this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like marketing is the one thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that keeps coming up is like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">yeah, this is like, I don't really know what to do</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or it's really hard and all that stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And also, just getting attention is just so hard.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Because everyone is screaming for attention.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like everybody, whether it's on Twitter,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or just social media or whatever.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:18.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And the realization I came to is that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:26.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the market is so saturated in terms of apps</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I'm gonna have to pay for some attention</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">as opposed to like earning it from scratch.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I just kind of like accepted that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm okay with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like most businesses have to pay to advertise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's kind of how it works, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's pretty normal, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you go to like any local business in your town,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're like, yeah, we have to advertise.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really know what's the problem, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's how it works.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The reason I wanted to start with podcast is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I was thinking about the sponsors</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or the ads that I have come across in different media,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">whether it's like, I don't really see YouTube ads anymore</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:12.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause I have YouTube premium,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but whether it was like YouTube or on Twitter</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or like, you know, Instagram ads are amazing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like they're, because you're always like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, that looks good, it looks good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the stuff that I always valued was,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of it comes from podcasts, to be honest with you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's something about hearing the host read it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That it just hits different, it just does.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:43.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so that's why I wanted to do that and start there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And again, I'd never written ad copy before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I was like, okay, I have to write ad copy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I like went back and like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I was like really listening to ads</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a different way than I was before.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:51:54.820 --> 00:52:02.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, yeah, so then I, and I picked a few Apple-centric podcasts, like Connected,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:10.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Focused, the talk show at the end of the year, sponsored. I actually even sponsored Daring</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Fireball over the summer, like the site. Oh, the website.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, which, so this is gonna sound weird, but like, I remember thinking, I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:23.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, one day I want, I want to, I want to sponsor that." Like, like, I've, like many of us read</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:29.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">daring fireball for years. And I just like, "Oh yeah, I want to do that one day." And I did it</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:35.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over the summer. It was great. And sponsoring a talk show was great. And all the other podcasts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:43.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was great. And I think the way I'm thinking of it is it's not like direct advertising,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:49.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like direct response where I'm expecting immediate returns on this stuff. Because if you think about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:56.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a lot of products that you come across or a lot of brands, you just, you get hit with so much stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:03.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">now that you may actually need to hear something a few times or come across something a few times</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">before you actually do anything about it. So... There's a name for that, right? Is that brand</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:14.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">advertising or... Yeah, brand advertising. Okay, yeah. Like that's like your Coca-Cola is sponsoring</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a skateboarding event or something. And it's like, obviously,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:25.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They don't have a special URL that everybody that goes to that event is, you know, going to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:33.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">coca-cola.com/extreme and they can directly attribute that, but it's like getting their</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:39.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">name more well-known, I guess. Yeah, or just keeping it in people's minds, that kind of stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Yeah, but for me, like, I'm literally starting from zero, right? Like, nobody knows</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:52.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who Sofa is and who I am. So, my approach to this is definitely more long-term and I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:00.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">am very happy with how everything performed this year in terms of like ROI, right? Like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:06.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">let's talk about ROI, bro, right? That's probably the word I hate the most is the word ROI.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Really? Oh.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a trash word.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:10.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You gotta pronounce it Roy in your head or Roe-y.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I like Roy. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, Roy is fun.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do they, do they have a, if we can say EBITDA, we can say Roy.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're pulling out the weird ones.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:20.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">EBITDA.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:21.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Let's talk about EBITDA.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:29.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, yeah, so, and the podcast stuff is, is it's like a form of brain advertising</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and direct response where like, I did say, Hey, go to sofa HQ.com/thetalkshow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:34.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I am able to see some metrics from that, but it's also not a guarantee that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people will go click on it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:39.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because they might just go to the app store or they might just not do anything.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">How did you, I mean, I won't ask specifics, just, I don't know if you don't want to like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:54.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">call out certain shows or whatever, but like, did you, like, did you feel like at least some</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:59.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of those they paid for themselves or was that an investment that's a long term thing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm trying to think because I don't want to, I don't want to say this in a way that like makes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">any other show look bad.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sure, right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:11.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would say in the aggregate, everything paid for itself and more.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay. - So, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:19.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it was well worth it and I plan to do more of it in 2023.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So do you have in your head or not in your head, in written down somewhere,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:33.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I should know the acronym for this off the top of my head, but how much a user is worth?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, like the lifetime value?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Thank you. - The LTVs?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes, LTV, there we go, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- LTV, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">LGTV.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We're turning into a real business podcast here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I know, look at us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I should go get a Patagonia vest, put that on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:49.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- There you go.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- With a nice top. - We're gonna move out</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to the valley or Miami.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Those are the two options, I think.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, oh, that sounds good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so there's a couple of metrics that I track.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">LTV is not one yet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">mostly because I've only had subscriptions</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for a year and a half.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, how could you know, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so I feel like there's a number there,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I don't think it's accurate enough</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to really track at this point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the metrics that I really look at</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are the monthly recurring revenues, so MMR,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and ARR, annual recurring revenue,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then active subscribers.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Those are the things that I'm actively looking at daily.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, yeah, that makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause that's like a thing that's, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a difference with advertising a subscription versus,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like I feel like I'm playing on easy mode</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in a lot of these, the little bit of advertising stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that I mess with, because it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:51.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there is a literal, very clear fixed dollar amount</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that each customer is worth to me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I can pay-- - Oh yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Basically up to that number</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I'm at least making money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Have you done ads?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I just use the app store ads.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, yeah, how's that go?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, so I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I just described the situation of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">oh, it's easy because I can just set,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:19.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">okay, my app is $9.99, so 15% off from Apple's cut</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then a little bit 'cause I want some profit margin.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's like I'm willing to pay $7 or something.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't remember what I have it set at,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but some amount and it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if I like make a sale,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and that's how they charge for the app store.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not like they click the link</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you have to get a conversion.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's literally, I'm paying for the ad</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if they download the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And in my case, them downloading the app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is they're paying for the app.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That actually makes a lot of sense for you, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- The thing is, I've noticed that I will have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:57:54.840 --> 00:58:03.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">big spikes in how many sales I get through ads whenever I have big sales in or big spikes</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in sales from other means.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:11.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like if I'm on a podcast or I'm featured on the app store or somebody writes about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:17.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">me in a blog or something, I'll also get a conspicuous spike in ad sales and I don't</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">understand if it's I think what's happening is people search dark noise and then a dark</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:27.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">noise ad shows. And so then they click the ad and it's like they were they were my customer</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:34.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">already at that point. Yeah. But now I just gave Apple, you know, 60% of of my my sale.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:41.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And so I don't know. I haven't done the work to figure out if that is accurate or if that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:48.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just this is my hunch, right? Based on. Yeah. Yeah. A sudden big bill from ads on the same</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">days that I think I've earned a lot of sales on my own.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But it certainly seems like there's that element to it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:00.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it feels like an easy calculation, but I think I'm actually still overpaying.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I don't know if I should be smarter about how I do that or how you avoid that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or if you just can't avoid that problem.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:10.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you just have that on like all the time like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:10.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:16.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So there's like multiple versions of how the app store does their ads.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But the like, I think the one I use is the basic one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Still, I think I messed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They have it a basic and advanced.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But because of my situation being paid up front,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:29.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">having that really simple filter of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you can just automatically bid me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you're going to do it based on, you know, likelihood</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that the person will click the ad because that makes Apple money.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then that benefits me, that benefits Apple, like it's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it kind of works out. But then there's those couple situations. Like I almost wish I could</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:56.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">remove and maybe the advanced ones I could like if I could remove the keyword my actual app name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which funnily enough, I feel like most developers, that's their complaint is that they have to buy</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">ads for their ad name so that competitors don't do the same.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I almost wonder if it's like if they're searching for my ad name,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have a high intent customer right there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that customer is worth way less than ad for that customer's worth way less to me</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than somebody else, because they're probably already coming for me.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And are they really going to get distracted and click on somebody else?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Maybe they would.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I'm throwing a bunch of things out here with no actual research on this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So take none of this as, you know, tried and true advice here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I mean, it takes a lot of like work to measure that stuff too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, like you kind of, you kind of like need infrastructure to do that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:51.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's, I, I forget, um, maybe it's the, uh, sub do you know the sub club podcast?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Sub club is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Uh, cause they actually know what they're talking about, um, around all these topics.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:58.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I remember, I forget who the guest was, but he was saying like, oh yeah, like if you have like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a small marketing budget and then like David Bernard, like stopped him and said, can you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">define small, please? Yeah. Like, um, and he's like, oh, like 20,000. And I was like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bro, that ain't small, right? Like, yeah, like, okay, maybe for like a bigger company. Sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. Yeah. Um, cause, and he was like, yeah, for any developers, 20 grand to spend on ads is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:33.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's a big ask right there. You know? It's such like, it's such a scary, even if you,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if you figure out one of those magical funnel things where it's like, I put $1 in and I get $2</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out. Um, right. It's like, if you have a whole bunch of money that you're willing to lose,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">then sure. Pour $50,000 into that bucket and get a hundred thousand dollars out. But</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:57.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">sure. If you don't have $50,000, uh, that you're willing to just throw away, if you did something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">wrong, it's like, that is really scary. Yeah. That's why I, yeah. And I think the podcast stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:09.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is much better. I think another benefit of the podcast stuff, sponsorship, especially with like</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:17.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the podcast that I did sponsor was, I also felt like I've gotten so much value from those podcasts</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:24.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">personally. I'm like, you know what, I'm happy to do this. Like I'm happy to sponsor this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I love these shows. And I've been listening for years. And it's like, this is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, like, I feel like it's almost like a way of also giving back. It's not charity,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know that, but it's like, that's also like a factor with those things too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I mean, it's kind of like, even though most of the time this isn't what it actually means,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the term sponsor, right? Like, that's kind of the idea is like, in a way you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I want this to keep going and also I want to benefit too. And like, this benefits both of us.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, there's a couple of shows I have on my radar in the same kind of vein where I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:11.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, even if it doesn't work out, I just really like the people that run this and this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:18.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">show. And yeah, it's meant a lot to me. And so yeah, no, that's that's a good point. And that's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a good reason to pick a show you like. And I feel like in your case with Sofa, especially,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like your target market has to be not has to be I'm guessing is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the exact type of people like Apple,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Apple oriented productivity type people who are more likely to be listening</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to a daring fireball or connected or something like that</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are also more likely to be the type of people who want a dedicated,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you know, rich Apple integration type app</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">for tracking their movies and TV shows and podcasts. Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:01.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And video games and board games video games and books and books. Yeah, I'm forgetting one</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, there might be another one in there. But yeah, there's there's a lot</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:10.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I agree. I think yeah, it's it's a I think it's a good fit</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think like long-term it can definitely expand out and</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There can be ways to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's actually like a weirdly hard</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">product to talk about because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because if you think I could go super specific and just talk about books, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or just talk about video games.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or I can go more broad, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And say, "Oh, it helps you be more intentional with your downtime.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And helps you organize your downtime."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I love that phrasing, by the way.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You say organizing your downtime, but the one I really like is the "be more intentional</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">about your downtime."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, no.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, you're right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That came out of writing the ad copy for the sponsors.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, interesting.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like to me, I've already gotten other benefits out of this where I wouldn't have sat down</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and wrote any of that stuff without this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it made me think about the product in different ways.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I've always called it like a downtime organizer, which it is.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, this phrase of like, it helps you be more intentional with your downtime because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hey, however you want to use your downtime is cool, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like if you want to just go on YouTube and watch stuff, fine, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If you want to go for a run, that's cool too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like whatever, however you want to use your downtime is fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But just be more intentional about it, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Be intentional with like, "Yeah, I'm going to doom scroll for 20 minutes or an hour."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">If that's what you need, like when we buy bags of Doritos here, like I eat the whole</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">bag because it tastes really good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:48.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I know in an hour it's going to be rough, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you made that you were intentional about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 100% intentional.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I knew, like I'll say to my wife, I'm like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is a bad idea, but I'm doing it, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I feel like this is something,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">probably a lot of people listening to this,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">if they're also, you know, sort of indie, on the side,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">working on things type people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I know a lot of my friends are the same way,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where it's like, we struggle with relaxing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's not that we're always productive,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's that when we have time, like I know for me,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I'm in a rough spell with dark noise in particular,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:31.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">launch is easier because it's editing and doing this</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is like it pulls you through the process, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't have a choice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I come out with a thing every other week</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it pulls me through.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But with dark noise, you have to show up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you said earlier, and like do the thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And sometimes I'm just like work depressed</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where I'm just like, I know I'm not gonna get anything</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">done tonight, but I'm so frustrated that I haven't accomplished anything the last</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">couple of days. I'll just open my laptop to will myself to do something and I'll</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:00.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just stare at it. And then the day will be over and I'm like, I should have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:05.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">played a game or watched an episode of whatever with my wife, because that's a</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:10.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">thing that I enjoy and I'm not doing instead. I'm just making myself, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:15.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">feel bad. Oh, it's so hard. And then you get into, and this is where something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like Sofa really comes into play,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:21.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">where you are like, all right, I'm taking the tonight off.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then it feels so precious.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like anybody with kids will know this feeling too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of like, you have the night off</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause grandma has the kids and you're like, all right,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">every single thing we do has to be the best version</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that we've ever done of this thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- All this pressure, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, you can't pick a restaurant</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you're like trying to pick the best restaurant</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you spend an hour, you finally pick one,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you're not, neither person's satisfied with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then you call up and they're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Yeah, we don't have a table</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"'cause it's already seven o'clock."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And you're like, "What did I do?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And having a list of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"Hey, these are some movies I wanna watch,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">"and I have two hours I can watch a movie,"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and just pick one from that list.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Huh. - Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's like the most first world of problems to describe,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but my goodness, does it make a big difference.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - 'Cause then you actually</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do the thing that you wanted to with your downtime.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Almost like when you explain it, it's like, that's it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, that's the idea?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, yeah, that's it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's pretty simple, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, it's amazing how just keeping a list</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of something can be a great tool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- 'Cause watching a movie is so much better</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">than scrolling Netflix for the same amount of time</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you could have watched a movie.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Now Blockbuster, that's different.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I would argue that the time I spent walking up</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">down the aisles in Blockbuster back in the day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That was valuable, intentional time, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Dude, that's a great, that's a great like comparison.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I never thought about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, going to Blockbuster was, that was awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That'd be like Friday night, Saturday night,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like yes, we're going to Blockbuster.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh my God, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- For one, you're wearing pants, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're not in your living room.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:05.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Wait, are you wearing pants right now?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The benefit of Zoom, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I thought this was the no pants podcast.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, okay.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">No, this is not a Curtis Herbert's show.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was it called?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">What was the name of it?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I forget too, but I know what you're talking about.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Wow, I'm struggling.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But anyway, no, I am wearing pants,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">just so we're all clear here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Blockbuster.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, Blockbuster, Blockbuster, good times.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Man, I know I've said it like three times this episode,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but you are really getting late night rambling, Charlie.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I like it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I like it, make it weird man, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Life is short, just get weird with it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It's good to have these every once in a while.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yes, yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, okay, so podcast sponsorships, good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Good for lots of reasons.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You feel like the Roy was good,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the Ebitduh, dud, it's Ebits.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:00.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It was Ebitin all day, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- No, I think that's the main thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Are there other things that you do as far as</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:13.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">marketing goes, I feel like sofa has a, like it has that presence and maybe</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is brand marketing is kind of how it gets there, but it's like, yeah, in</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">my head, it's sort of like, it is the app for this space that I think of when I</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">think, oh, I want to track some new thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like, that's where I go to like, think about it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Um, and of course your website is beautiful.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Anybody who.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Hey, thanks.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Wants to make a, uh, like app, a website one, prepare yourself.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You're not probably, if you're not a designer,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you're probably not gonna pull off what you've done</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">over probably a long period of time with SofaHQ.com,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it's just ripe with ideas you can steal.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll just say that 'cause I know</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I've certainly stolen ideas from it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Oh my God, I've never had an original idea in my life.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like everything is stolen, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:02.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, you've seen that video,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Everything's a Remix, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that's kind of a story.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I mean, but it's so true.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you just build on each other,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even if you have no idea you're doing that, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So it's totally fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Steal away, you're good.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:15.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, we're talking about generative AI now, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That's right, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">(both laughing)</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, I'm gonna stop that tangent</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">before I start going down that one.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Ooh, that could be, yeah, that's quite a topic</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that we could go very deep on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- It is, well, the last episode was literally about that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I just listened to that today.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Came out just the other day.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Nice, nice.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yes, I told you I'm a fan of the show, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's a good show, I like it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, so before I wrap up,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's one other little thing I had in here,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is like, I guess this is related to marketing,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so we'll just say this is part of that same topic.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Sure. - Do you find yourself</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">counter-positioning to what the big players</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in each of these spaces are doing?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'Cause you have movie tracking,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and there's obviously IMDb or Letterboxd</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something like that, or like Goodreads for books</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:10.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or something like that, or do you kind of treat it like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">no, this is a totally separate thing from those,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">this is sort of an all-in-one place for all of your stuff?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I'm just curious how you approach that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I don't want this to sound rude at all,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't mean this to be rude in any way, shape, or form,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but I really don't pay attention to those apps.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">The person that I have in mind</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the person that I am kind of thinking</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that SOFA is really for is the person who is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">they're already keeping these lists.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">They already do this, but they use Apple Notes, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Or reminders.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, hey, that's cool.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's cool you're doing that, but this is way better.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">This is so much better than that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And that's the person that I'm really focused on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because I think the type of,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">when I think about the type of app that I think SoFi is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or I want it to be aspirationally,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think it's this weird mix between</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the kind of simplicity and experience</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of something like Apple Notes,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.280</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but to have the power and the flexibility</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of something like a spreadsheet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I love spreadsheets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like for people who know spreadsheets,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:36.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like they understand like why people love spreadsheets</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">'cause they're infinitely flexible</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you can kind of do anything in there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like spreadsheets literally run the world.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like the world runs on spreadsheets.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's unbelievable. - Oh yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- But the experience of like editing those spreadsheets,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like it kind of sucks, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like you gotta set everything up.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's like very tedious.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So I'm trying to, I think there's this middle ground</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:01.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">between like a great design</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and great experience of using the thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:07.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">without it feeling like this big intimidating spreadsheet,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but it also has a ton of flexibility.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So that's really what I'm going for.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And there's a lot of people today</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who track this stuff in spreadsheets too, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, and like, you can go on YouTube,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">people make these amazing spreadsheets of like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">here's all the books I read this year</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and it has all these stats and stuff.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like it's so, it's amazing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">It's so incredible. - Oh, wow.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So like I'm more interested in the person</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">who is tracking stuff in Apple Notes today</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and the person who's like making a custom spreadsheet.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right, like I think those are really interesting</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and long-term I'd like to kind of bridge the gap there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And I think those other services, they're awesome, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And they're for very specific people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But I don't really see Soph as like competing with them.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I see them as more of like maybe a companion</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in different ways, you know?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- That makes sense.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.300</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.140</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- I like that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Cool, okay, well, before I wrap this up then,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'll ask you the question I ask everybody in the show,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">which is what is a person or people out there</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that have inspired you that you'd recommend others check out?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I have a list.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I have five people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:29.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">five people. So first person is this, this guy's actually, he was the original</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developer on Sofa. So Oliver Pfeffer, he's just, he's an amazing, amazing iOS</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">developer. He's still, we're great friends. And the amount that I have</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:46.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">learned from him over the years is just, it's just incredible. The dude's super</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">smart. And he's one of those people who like is not, he's not like, um, he's not</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">very active on social media. Like you're not going to see all these posts from</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">him and stuff like that. And there's so many people like that who were just</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">killing it. They're just like so good at what they do, but they don't necessarily</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">talk about what they do. Right? It's the Twitter's not real life meme on Twitter.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:16.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, 100% right. Yeah. But I like, I just, I've learned so much from him.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:23.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">him and still continue to learn so much from him. So he's amazing. The next four people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:29.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are the reason I want to highlight these people are because they are the people I learned</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:38.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the most from when I was first starting out with iOS development back in 2017. So Meng</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">too of design and code.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:50.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So he was like the perfect bridge for me because he's a designer and he knew how to explain</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">development concepts to a designer.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I'm like, "Oh yeah, thank you.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Now I understand how delegation works, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like that makes total sense now, right?"</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Whereas before I'm like, "I have no idea what this even means."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:11.420</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So his stuff is amazing, design and code, and he's still doing great work.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Mark Mojkins, I don't know if I'm saying his name correctly, but he has a YouTube channel,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.580</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Big Mountain Studio.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:23.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think he does a lot of like SwiftUI stuff now, but also someone who has good way of</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:28.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">explaining things to beginners when it comes to iOS development.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:31.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Because I'm sure there's a lot of people who listen to the show who are like, "I want to</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">do this.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:39.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">iOS development. And these are great people to, to like learn from. They have tons of free content</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:44.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">out there and stuff. It's amazing. Uh, Sean Allen has another one. He's another one on YouTube.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:53.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Great stuff. First, very like literally when I was told that I could switch over to an iOS team</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:17:53.660 --> 01:18:00.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">in 20, well, this would have been the end of 2018. And, uh, I was like, this is amazing. I'm so</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:06.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">excited I need to figure out what any of it is. I downloaded Xcode, went to BreadCo, which is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:13.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Panera, but St. Louis here. And, uh, it's called, long story, anyway, the very first thing I watched</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was the Sean Allen video. And I don't know why, but it was, it was about whether you should have,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:23.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it was storyboards versus, uh, oh yeah. Like, uh, like developing kit. What is the word?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:30.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I didn't know what storyboards were or what UI kit was. Well, I probably knew what UI kit was</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:35.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">at that point. But like, that was the level of basicness that I had. And that video, like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:41.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it sounds silly, but it's like, it established that this is a debate in the world. And like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:45.740</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that it was so helpful. So yeah, also a hard second on Sean Allen there.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:50.060</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, great stuff. And the last one is, I mean, you've heard this one a million times,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.260</p>
<p class="transcript-line">but like Paul Hudson, just the number of times his site still comes out when like I search</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:04.220</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Swiss stuff is just like wild. Yeah, just another, he just, he knows how to explain stuff to people.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:04.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And yeah. So, I'm just so thankful to all these people because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:15.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I, you know, SoFa wouldn't exist without them, to be honest. So, very, very, very thankful for that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:24.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. And you're contributing to that sort of broad ecosystem of things, you know, learning,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:31.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">watching people work. Like you said, Paul Hudson, I feel like his live streams that he does</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.700</p>
<p class="transcript-line">are... Yes.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:39.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That's the closest I've ever gotten to... The first job I had with iOS, we did pairing all</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">the time. So I got to literally just sit with somebody who actually knew what they were doing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.100</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and like... That's awesome.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Watch how they moved the cursor around. You know what I mean? It's those little things that you</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:53.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">You just, books don't teach you that.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And even most tutorials that are trying</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to teach you about concepts,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that's not what they're focused on</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because like, why would they be?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But Paul Hudson's live streams,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.440</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and I know other people do these too,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.180</p>
<p class="transcript-line">surprisingly amazing because you're like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">what did he just do?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And he's like fumble, you know,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">he had a typo or something</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and then he fixed it the certain way</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and you're like, whoa.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.840</p>
<p class="transcript-line">That kind of stuff I feel like is super valuable too.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.980</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, learning through video.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:23.620</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like you're hitting on it, like so many articles</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.600</p>
<p class="transcript-line">will either, you know, maybe inadvertently</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or do it on purpose, make assumptions that,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't need to say this thing 'cause this person will know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:33.880</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.900</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And then you go, I feel like I'm missing something here.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I don't really get it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But when you have to watch someone do a video,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's harder for them to just like skip over it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like they have to do it.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So the video stuff is great.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Right, well, and it's a delicate balance, right?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">because it's like when you do know those things,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.860</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's infuriating sitting through a video</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.460</p>
<p class="transcript-line">of somebody doing that thing.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.780</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But then when you don't,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:58.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">so it's like Apple, like WWDC videos are,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.660</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like the example of video where it's like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">even when they're typing code,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:07.500</p>
<p class="transcript-line">like that is so rehearsed to the point of extremism</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.380</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that you're not gonna get any of those things.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.820</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But you also wouldn't want it in that context.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.940</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Do you wanna go another hour on Apple's documentation?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:23.540</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh my goodness. I think what you meant was a hacking with swift.com. It's great. It's</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:31.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">a wonderful documentation. Incredibly well done. Yeah, I have. Yeah. Weird thoughts about</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:37.020</p>
<p class="transcript-line">that. Coming. I came from the Microsoft world and I used to complain about, you know, MSDN</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:41.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and their, their documentation and coming over to Apple world. The very first thing</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:50.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">was, "Holy cow, all of the bloggers and third party people in this space are amazing."</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:56.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Like, I've never... You go to Hacking with Swift and at the top it says, "This was updated...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.400</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Last updated two months ago." And you're like, "Oh my gosh, they update their blog posts? What</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">is that?" I never experienced that before. But then I think in part, the reason why maybe is</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:13.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">there's a huge gap when it comes to Apple's documentation itself, especially if you're</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:20.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">doing the audio APIs or some of these older, maybe less loved areas. Oh, that's a good point.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.480</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Oh, man.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.720</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I feel like you're sort of digging through history with Apple Docs a lot of times because</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">you open up a page and you're like, "Oh, this is from this era because it's a totally different</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:39.240</p>
<p class="transcript-line">design and it looks super weird and you're like this one will actually tell me stuff but</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">most of it will be out of date and that's kind of the the balancing act so yeah oh my yeah</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:53.960</p>
<p class="transcript-line">i'm like i'm trying to resist temptation here ollie a couple years ago i remember i i said</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:22:53.960 --> 01:23:00.200</p>
<p class="transcript-line">something like off the cuff like oh yeah i did check like uh crash reports in uh app store connect</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.760</p>
<p class="transcript-line">He's like, "Why? Why are you doing that? You could do it in Xcode." I was like, "Oh,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:10.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">hell." And he showed me. I'm like, "Well, how was I going to find that?" Right? Like,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:16.520</p>
<p class="transcript-line">how was I going to know to go dig into this menu and find the organize, you know, window?</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:22.120</p>
<p class="transcript-line">And then, "Oh, that's where I get my crash reports." It's like, "What?" It just, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.000</p>
<p class="transcript-line">There's just like so many. And it's very big, right? Which is fine.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.560</p>
<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. It's huge. And old, you know, in terms of...</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.800</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- And old, yeah, totally, yeah.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:33.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">But there is the education stuff</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160</p>
<p class="transcript-line">or just general documentation is,</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.920</p>
<p class="transcript-line">it's a little rough for sure.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- We have a gluttony of options of really high quality</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">and polished stuff from NotApple.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.040</p>
<p class="transcript-line">So, you know.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.320</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, agreed.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.680</p>
<p class="transcript-line">- Win some, you lose some.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.640</p>
<p class="transcript-line">All right, well, I will actually wrap this up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.360</p>
<p class="transcript-line">myself of like, ooh, I should try that after after I get off this call. So</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I thank you for continuing to do this and thanks for having me on.</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.340</p>
<p class="transcript-line">I think the only hard part is convincing smart people</p>


<p class="time-stamp">01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.080</p>
<p class="transcript-line">to come on and then I just get to like poke</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:24.760</p>
