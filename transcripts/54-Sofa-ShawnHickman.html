<p class="time-stamp">00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Welcome to the launched.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm Charlie Chapman and today I'm excited to bring you the developer behind the downtime</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">organizer, Sofa.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sean Hickman.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">[Music]</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sean, welcome to the show.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Thank you for having me, Charlie.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Very happy to be here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Very honored to be here, actually.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, well, thank you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's kind of funny.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Normally, this is an opportunity to see somebody</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for the first time or maybe have seen their face on Twitter</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or something like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But because of the stuff you do on YouTube</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that we'll get to later,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like I'm familiar with your office layout.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I know where you're at</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and positioned to your space in a way</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I don't normally already have</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">sort of pre-baked in my mind.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I'm always, I like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">ran out the office a little bit.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like I need a plant in the back somewhere.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">People on YouTube have plants.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And every time I see one, I go,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, it's a good looking plant.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And you need two contrasting LED lights,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like a, like a, like a blue green and orange or something, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- That's how you know you're like a tech YouTuber.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Right, you have some kind of RGB light,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that kind of stuff, 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Really shallow depth of field.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, blur out the background.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You don't even want to see the background at all.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Just blur.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- The perfect podcast content</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is when you talk about stuff that nobody listening can see.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Since you can see it, I will point out here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've got a couple green plants here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Literally got those for Christmas,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">took them out of the box and put them there</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so that I don't have a pile of boxes in her house.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know how you do with Christmas stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that's the extent of it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So not super organized over here yet,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but there is some green showing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">your playing game is way better than mine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Well, they exist, so I guess I have that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So props to you, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- All right, well, before we get into</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">sofa and your YouTube channel eventually</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and all this stuff you do, I wanna give everyone</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">an introduction to who you are,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">other than the lack of your plant background.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So the three questions I always ask everybody</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to kick things off here is where you from.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Do you have a formal education related to what you do?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then we can talk about your career leading up to Sofa.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I am from suburbs outside of Philly,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">specifically a township called Delco, or Delber County.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's why my voice sounds like this,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which, you know, that'll probably come up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It comes up a lot with people who are not from the area</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and even from the area.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I wanna interject.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'Cause you said this before we started recording.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- You said, I'm from a specific suburb</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and that's where the accident comes from.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So this is like, it's not a Philly thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's a specific area or well outside of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so from what I understand at some point,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there was like a large migration of people from South Philly</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">into the suburbs and a lot of them made up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">what is now Delaware County.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And you say, oh, Delaware County, it's in Delaware.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you go, no, it's in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's called Delco for short.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's actually been like made fun of on SNL and stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's kind of like made its way into pop culture</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a little bit interesting.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, but we're oddly known for the way</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">we pronounce words and stuff like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You're holding on to the regional accent.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like most of those are like raining away in America.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm representing Delco today.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah, there you go.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so Delco.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then the next thing would be formal education.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so formal education.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I went to college for graphic design.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I'm professionally a designer</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and that was back in 2007 when I graduated graphic design.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was like advertising focused,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">people would say, oh, what do you do with graphic design?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I would always be like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, I make like CD covers, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Which is hilarious now.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">When I graduated, that's the year that the iPhone came out the first iPhone.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, "Oh, like, I want to do that."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I had no idea what that even was.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just wanted to do it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You wanted to make cover flow images, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I want to make all the album artwork for cover flow.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. You know, formally trained as a graphic designer and then over time,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">got into software, UX, UI, all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and eventually writing apps.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so after, so career leading up to this,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so school, I did an internship at the end</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">of like towards the end of my schooling.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it was with like an advertising thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">where they made like credit card mailers.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Ooh, that sounds exciting and fulfilling.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I remember just feeling so much regret,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was like, what did I choose for my career?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, is this what I'm gonna be doing forever?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I was just like, I can't do this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- My first job out of college,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or actually internship was an insurance claims processing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So-- - But there you go.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Similar level of excitement and fulfillment.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I'm surprised you're not still doing it, isn't it?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So much fun?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, well, you know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So you can only handle so much of the heat, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's a really intense area, you know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, if you can't handle the game, you gotta get out.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, that's what it is, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Right, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Like I said, like the iPhone was announced for the end.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So then I started trying to get mobile design jobs.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was like, oh, I can, I'll do mobile design.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But everywhere I would say, well,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you need like four to five years of experience</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">designing for mobile.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then I would say, well, the iPhone just came out.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like how is that even possible?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like how would anyone have that experience?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Unless you were designing for like blackberry or something.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, Windows Mobile.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You weren't all over that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because it had like the start menu at the bottom</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and everything. - Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I did have a palm trio back in the day too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Ooh.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So, which I liked quite a bit.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And now I work as a design manager at a design firm</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in Philly called Think Company.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I've been there for the past eight years.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Nice, okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And how, like, were you doing indie stuff on the side</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this whole time, or was so kind of your first play</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in that space?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So if I had like a longer story than people probably know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So when I was at QVC, you should do a podcast about that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I should.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Do you know any one?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I could do that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll ask around.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">OK.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I got a fine spot.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So at QVC, I met two coworkers.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">One was-- they were both developers.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">One was iOS, one was web developer, headed off.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And we actually got together and made the first version of SOFA.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This was back in 2015.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The very first version was like, only movies, like you could only add movies to it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it was very discovery focused.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So we would like curate these lists of movies that you could watch and then you could</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">add them to a list if you want to watch them later.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Was the whole database like did you enter everything in or were you using something like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">was it the movie database?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, the movie database was our main data source.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So, and then we built just like a little CMS</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in our own little API layer over that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to power the curated list that we put together.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So that was 2015 and then, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">life got busy for everybody.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm still very good friends with both of those guys.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I wanted to keep going with it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I had more ideas and I was like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"God, I think there's something here."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:33.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I said, all right, well, I figured out, like I'll learn iOS development and build an app, right? Like how hard could </p>it`be? Right? Famous last words. It was very hard. And in 2017, I launched like, sofa 2.0, which was like, completely different app from the, from the original and very, very simple. Like, you know, it was like a baby app at first. Was it more simple than the one dot version? Oh, yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was literally just like, you can make lists</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then you can put either movies or TV shows</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">into those lists.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like it was, and it was almost like a to-do list.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You could like check stuff on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I like reach out to someone in the press to like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Hey, would you like to write a review about this?"</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And they very kindly said,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Your apps, maybe a little too basic at this point,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">maybe reach out when it's a little more flesh out."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was like, "That was very nice way to say no."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and ever since 2017 just been iterating on it ever since.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So, wow, so was the first version like, let's see, 2017?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Was it paid up front or did you have subscriptions at that point already?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">No, so subscriptions I only recently introduced in July of 2021.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So originally it was just free, because to be honest, I was like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this is not good enough for anyone to pay for.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So after a little bit, I did, I actually did change it to a pay</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">eight app, so it was then $499.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I think I made like a hundred bucks or something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">over a couple months.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- What was your like aspiration?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like were you thinking this will eventually be something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I'll make paid, you know, before you use</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">what you're doing? - Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - Okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So the idea was I'll build this up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to something at some point.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I've always wanted it to be a like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">full-time business and all that stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's, you know, it's moving towards that direction,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is great, but it's, I've obviously like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I had a very meandering journey on the way there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Man, that's fascinating.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, so trying to think,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so this has been around for a while,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I feel like what you're describing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and what I think of it's sofa,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or at least when it came on my radar,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">are very different things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I guess just kind of walk us through that journey</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to get up to there, like subscription,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or like business model changes,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but also just how you add it onto it</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in terms of finding areas of value from people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so first release in 2017, so for 2.0 was free.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then I forget when I changed it to a paid app,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">when it was $4.99, maybe like a year later,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or something like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And at that point, I'd add it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You could add like podcasts to it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You could add books to it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So there was like, there was more things there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And where was that coming from?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Was that like you had sort of a roadmap in your head</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or these are things you found yourself wanting?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Or were you getting feedback from people?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and that was sort of driving what features you added.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Back in December of 2022, I released,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna be jumping all over the place.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Charlie, Jeff, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So in last December of 2022,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I released SOFA 3.4.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that was like, there's features in that version</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I have been wanting since 2017, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, you can have shared lists with like your spouse</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or your friend or something, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And right now it's like it's a beta feature</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause there's some iOS 16 quirkiness to iron out there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There's that, there's shortcut support.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like there's a couple of things that I feel like it's at a point</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">where the foundation is there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And now I can really start iterating on</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like the core product in new ways.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, interesting.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's almost like the sort of vision you have in your head</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is really only recently fully realized.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And now you're at that point of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">how do you build on top of that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's how I feel about it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, a lot of stuff is, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you go down some directions and you're like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, that didn't work."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Feedback from people,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I would, you know, people,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">coworkers and stuff who would use it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who were very generous with their time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I remember when I was doing the paid app</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it was $4.99 and I was telling my uncle about it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's like, "Oh, that sounds really cool."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I was just explaining the app.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I literally watched him go to the App Store.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he's like, it's like, $4.99.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's like, I don't pay for apps.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was like, bro, are you serious?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, I've run into this one.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- You're my uncle.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">What the hell?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, well, if I can't get my uncle</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to pay for this, what shot do I have here?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:49.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So that's when I actually then made the app free again</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all over the place, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And actually, so in 2020, I added themes,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like custom themes and stuff like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I started selling themes individually,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">thinking like, oh, okay, like maybe I make</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a bunch of different themes, they're really,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">really nice or just like quirky in different ways.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">People will buy them and they'll be like $1 or $2 or something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like that and that with enough volume that would be,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that would be okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like the filters or something for camera apps.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've heard you talk about the, almost like the hesitancy</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">of like charging for stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And when I look back, I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, I think I was just scared to do subscription.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I should have done it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, like that was the obvious decision</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I was just like afraid to do.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, well, I'll try this other thing first.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then, you know, and then I'll change it</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if it doesn't work.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, and then in 2021, July of 2021,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So for 3.0 came out with the subscription to Super Sofa,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is like the Pro version,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is a fantastic name, by the way.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, thanks, man.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I feel like it's hard to come up with a,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like I went through this a lot,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause I was like, I don't wanna just slap Pro</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">at the end or plus at the end,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because that's what everybody does.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But what I realized is like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's really hard to come up with a QT name</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's also very clear and obvious</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that this is a Pro version of it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But super is almost, it has the same connotation,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but it works so well with Sofa that I feel like you kind of,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you kind of pulled it off having a sort of QT unique name</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's also clear.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, well that's good to hear.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I'm wondering if like some of it is too cute,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's like the first time you go to Starbucks</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you say, oh can I get a large coffee?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And they go, you want a venti?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I go.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I don't know, is that a large?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll take that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- You just kind of roll your eyes like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, you're like, you have to like know the language, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, it's like a fine line between that stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, and it is tricky.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And like, I feel like there's a reason everybody,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's kind of like all the TV subscription apps</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">being plus now at the end.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like everything's plus.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's easy to make fun of it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but also it's a real,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like when you're in the position of naming something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or marketing something and you go,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, there's a very, very small number of characters thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I can slap on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that is immediately understood by everybody.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's a golden goose that's really hard to replace.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and if I was doing the super stuff of stuff today,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like NetNew, I may call it so for plus, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, just to lean into that more.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- But yeah, super so if I think is, it's fun.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's fun to say for sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, that's the point of the app too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sometimes I think like it's to be fun, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But sometimes I think like, oh, I should come up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with like an even better version that is like super duper sofa.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, no, but then that just gets like really stupid.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I probably won't do that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So you've mentioned a couple times</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">getting feedback from people and like, yeah,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">looking at your suite of things that you have now,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like like I know you have a discord</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and there's a community, a whole community page</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">on your website and it's kind of like a concept</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that you seem to really be leaning into.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I'm assuming you didn't have that whenever you</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I had an app that was just one list that you could add to.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So how did what was the journey to get to where you are now?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And why do you have so much stuff around that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- To community stuff is hard.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't, I don't even know how to explain this,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I'm not good at participating in communities.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm good at lurking in communities,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even on Twitter or like I'm on Mastown now,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like we all are.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">My natural reaction is to not say anything</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">not post ever. It's just to watch other people, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Just kind of like absorb it. So it actually takes a lot of effort and energy to even</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:58.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">write anything on these on these platforms. But there's like things where I've been inspired</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:05.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">by certain products that have just done it well. And maybe it's just like kind of luck</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">how it happens, but like the app of city and like their</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Discord communities and even their forums are just wild.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like yeah, so good. Just so much great information. People are just,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they just like are obsessed with obsidian.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's definitely one of those cult type projects. No,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or similar. No, Shen. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I almost</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">had Rome and then I realized I'm just listing all of the, uh, the</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">PKM stuff. Yeah. All the PKM. What is that? PKM.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Personal knowledge management. Oh, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">My other yourself as a nerd in that way. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. So stuff like that. I'm just like, Oh, it's great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because when you're getting into a product like that yourself,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which you're like, Oh, is this any good?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The community is like a feature of it really.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">For sure. Because you get to learn how other people set stuff up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You can reach out for help, all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So if you think about from, hey, I'm one person,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like being an indie developer,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you kind of need all the help you can get.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And there's a lot of, I think, just mutual benefit</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to having a closer connection</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and like line of communication between yourself</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and people who either use the product</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or just fans of it for getting feedback,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for helping other people, ideally things go well,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">hey, they can help with support,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because someone asks a question,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it's like, maybe someone else jumps in and answers, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, maybe I can't get to it right away or something.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But also, they have a hand in,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think shaping the product at this point too,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because I'm trying to post more as I'm working,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which again is very unnatural,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">feels very uncomfortable,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I'm trying to do it more,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it actually is nice because stuff I'm working on where it's just like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, like you have an idea and you're just kind of like riffing on it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then someone points something out and you go, oh, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's actually a good point. Like I'll fix that. Right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll do it in real time. And you do it before you ship anything.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And those people have a hand in actually making the product better,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which I think again, it's just like a nice little, uh,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">mutual ecosystem if, if it all goes well.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm always so jealous of, uh,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">thinking of Indies, I think of like drafts or even like Christian</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">C. like with Apollo. Yeah. I feel like most apps that can pull it</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:41.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">off. It's like it's sort of like the creative, productive, like life</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">hacky. That's not the right term. I don't know what the right term</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it. Well, maybe it's the acronym you said a minute ago, but pkm.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:54.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's all about the pkm. Get in there, man. Get in there. But like, it's hard</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to have it, I feel like it's only certain niches of apps that can kind of have that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I guess Apollo is not that at all, but it's a Reddit app, so it makes sense that a network</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">built around communities would also form a good community, but there's so many benefits</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if you can pull that off.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I imagine there's also some trickiness to it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Do you find yourself having to do moderation?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Or I guess I don't know what size you're dealing with.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:26.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, it's small right now. So like the Discord server has like, I think less than 100 people in it. Okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:32.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Very manageable at this point. Yeah, I'm worried about it too to be honest with you. So I had a,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:40.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I actually had a, I set up a forum discourse forum and also can we talk about the names of these products discourse </p>and`discord like who did this?

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:46.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Hmm. Yeah, that's a little too close to it. Yeah. Very confusing. Um, so yeah,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This course is the forum stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I actually had that set up like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you would go to like forum.sofahq.com.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I ran that for like a year,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it was just like too much work.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I shut it down at the beginning of 2022,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because it was just, I stole the full-time job.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm doing this on the side.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I have to be very picky with where I'm putting my time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that was, it was just taking up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">too much of my time to kind of check</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and all that stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was paying for it too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It was just like a hosted thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I set up a Reddit whenever I first made Dark Noise.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And actually I think it's still out there</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and there's even a link to it in the app.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And like, everyone swells somebody will post in there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">For the longest time, I didn't know of a way</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to get notifications on that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I got out of the habit of checking it because--</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And then I go there and there'd be like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">other people would answer the question,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but then somebody would ask something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and there'd just be nothing for like two months</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I'd be like, oh my gosh, I can't believe.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I did find out if FTT, wow, I can't remember.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't remember what it stands for.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Anyway, I'll get it in the next.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">If this, then that, thank you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">PKM is what you're thinking of.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Starting with the acronyms tonight.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But that there is a way with that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I could set up some sort of notification.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Actually, you know what?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Now Apollo, which we just mentioned,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:21.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Reddit app, it has notifications on sub-redits that you can set up. I think I did not.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Maybe it's with just with Apollo Ultra. I'm not sure if you don't have it and you use</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Reddit. I pay for it. No, no, I'll try. It's worth it. Yeah, it's good. I use Apollo every</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">day. I love it. I probably sound like a moron. I didn't know. I didn't know you could set up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the notifications for like streaming. It's not knowing a feature that's in Apollo is definitely</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a forgivable offense because that's fairs. Thank you. A billion of them. I need a</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, very kind.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Christian Nelson, you my invoice</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for your accidental ad later today.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, so Paulo, go get it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It definitely is a thing that you have to keep up with</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or it can turn on you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that's especially true with just support in general.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Actually, maybe this is a little rabbit hole</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">we can go down because we're recording at night</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so you're getting unstructured Charlie.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">How do you deal with support?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've noticed your website is one beautiful,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but two, has a lot of things regarding frequently asked questions</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and support and community features.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">How do you manage that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because I have been spectacularly failing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with Dark Noise with keeping up with email.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I don't know what to do since I don't have,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's not my full time job and I can't say,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I spend four hours every Friday morning or something on it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how to deal with it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It can be a lot of times.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">What I do that is, so what's helped me is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if I get a question from someone via email,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's pretty common that,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or it's pretty likely that someone else</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is gonna have that question.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So what I will do is I will set aside 15 minutes</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and just write that up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's like, you know, a support document on the website.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then I will just, here's the link, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, oh, I have an answer to that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Here's the link.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I can't tell you how much time it's saved long term</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to take 10 to 15 minutes right up the support page.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then the number of times I shared just the link</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">instead of rewriting it is it's wild.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like every time I go,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, I'm so glad I did this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">In the moment, it's easy to just not do it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There's times where I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't feel like doing this, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I've been saved so many times by it</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that it's just worth it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's like I'm asking a 102 year old man,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">how did you do it, how did you stay so healthy?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And they're like, I ate my vegetables</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and took a walk every day.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like it's like, oh, right, yes, there is an easy answer to this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'm just not doing the hard thing once</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and instead I'm taking the lazy approach.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yes, we'll just say that that was an aside</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for the sake of the audience.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so they could hear that advice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And not because I have not been doing that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Easy just said, I've been done.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And, but yeah, there's, I mean, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there's, there's periods where like the email support</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">just like gets a little too high.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- That's the thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that's what happens to me is where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you get overwhelmed with it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then it's like, well, I can't stop</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and focus on getting this support stuff all written</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">built up because I'm trying to get through all these emails and then the emails go away</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then you stop, you know, focusing on that, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I think it's just like a forever struggle to just, you know, do your best.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:48.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Do you use, do you just use like normal email or do you have some kind of help triage system</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or service or something?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just do it the dumb way.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just have like an email address that people and it just comes in and I go,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all right, I'll answer this email now.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so yeah, I know there are better tools</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:06.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">out there, but I part of it kind of likes the just the like, yeah, it's just email. I don't</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:14.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">know. Like it's just really simple. Yeah, I don't mind it to be honest with you. So to kind of pull</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">back into a normal show here, we already talked about the fact that you did switch over to</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">subscriptions, but we haven't talked about how that actually went. So one, the switch itself,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but then also how has that like impacted the business?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. It's been great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:40.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's been a year and a half since subscriptions have launched and I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">man, I wish I did it sooner. Like so, so good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:52.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's it's scary at first because you're like, all right, like I'm asking for real money here and</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I get feedback from people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This is not very frequent, but like you can even see on the App Store page.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This is too expensive, right? This is too expensive.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:13.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think compared to other apps, like a personal plan for the years, 35 bucks for the year,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:19.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">right? And if you compare that to Apollo, which is like, I think it's like 10 bucks a year.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like super cheap.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think he's under, he's underpriced.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- He's got scale too though.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I don't want to say anything about his business</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">necessarily 'cause I don't have insight knowledge,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but he's definitely playing on a different,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">stratosphere I feel like in a lot of different ways.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so like I'll hear that feedback and stuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but like the growth over the past year and a half</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">has been really great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'm not picking up on any signs that like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's overpriced.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's things are growing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Plenty of people are very happy to pay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And yeah, I would, so I did like a 2022 year in view video.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:11.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And in that I was like, I was talking to my wife,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I was like, I don't know what to share here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like I am not comfortable, like, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was growing up, like you don't talk about money.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Don't do that, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's rude, that's weird.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'm like not comfortable, like sharing numbers.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So in that video I was like, okay, what can I share</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I am comfortable with or kind of comfortable with?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that was just like year over year growth.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And you like, you did a good job of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">pre-pending that with.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I know like you don't know what the initial numbers are,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:48.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">thought that was great. That's my comfort level at this point. But I also know that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like as like indie developers, information, that kind of information is really helpful</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:03.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for us. So I feel a mix of guilt by not giving back to that community that I've learned</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a ton from and have benefited from. But I'm also like, I don't know, man, it's my, it's</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like financial stuff and that's pretty private.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's a really weird subject in part</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because of the same, yeah, like companies</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">are always like don't talk to other employees</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about how much you pay, or how much you paid,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which of course they're not supposed to do</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and there's that angle of it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- But then they do anyway.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So there's a bunch of weird financial things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But even if you, like I, especially 'cause,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, my stuff all started really small.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I didn't have any qualms about it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I've watched, I've talked about this on the show before,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I watched Jordan Morgan be extremely open</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and thought that was helpful.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so I was like, oh, I'll just do the same thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Well, like, since Dark Noise has grown some,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and in my opinion, has grown despite me</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and the lack of time and the skill</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or whatever you wanna say that I was able to put towards it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there is an element even once you've accepted,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm just going to share everything where you start feeling guilty, sharing everything because</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you're like, am I giving a false like pretense to somebody?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I got super lucky and somebody could do all the same things as me and the numbers</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">are way lower and am I actually making it worse by putting this out there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:33.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think it's just like saying anything publicly is uncomfortable, correct.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so saying things are not saying things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't know. I think there's pros and cons, anything. So everybody has to come to what they're</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:45.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">comfortable with. But even if you share everything, it's not like, now you feel like you're,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, on top of the world and whatever. Yeah, it's, it's a weird topic. But when people do it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I, I love it. I'm like, oh, this is great. I'm learning. This is awesome. Yeah. So that's,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:02.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's where like my girl comes from because I feel like I'm withholding. Yeah. So no, because what</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you're doing, and we can just go ahead and jump into this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I have a whole topic on different marketing things, but one of the marketing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">things that you've done is you have a YouTube channel.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. But it's not like just here's the features of Sofa.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Here's how you can do how he's your thing. And sofa, it's also like here's</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a behind the scenes look at how I created my press kit. Like that's literally</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you have a video about that, which is obviously not just for you selling,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:38.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">copies of of so far it's it's for the community and I feel like that kind of stuff is arguably a lot more beneficial </p>even

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Where did that all kind of come from?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:46.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I mean I watch a lot of YouTube like an unhealthy amount maybe but it's great</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I mean I I</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:55.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Mean it's so many people say it's like just the things you can learn on YouTube. It's just unbelievable</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:01.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Most of the things I've learned about iOS development, I learned on YouTube. It's just so good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:16.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And one of the things I, there's like photography is a hobby of mine, and that whole area of YouTube is very </p>interesting,

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:23.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because they do tons of behind-the-scenes stuff. And I'm like, one of the things I love watching, which is, it's </p>going`to sound really weird,

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:31.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I love watching behind the scenes videos of photographers at weddings because to me,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's something I would never want to do because the stress, it just seems like don't</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">screw this up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There's one shot here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They just kill it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They just do so well.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:48.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They're also shooting behind the scenes stuff as they're doing this person's wedding,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But it's such a great way to learn too, like as of, you know, to learn photography and</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">then there's this also, uh, they POV videos of photographers.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They like hook a GoPro up to their chest and then like walk around and take pictures.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's such a great way to learn how they take pictures, like how they frame stuff, what</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">their settings are, what they're seeing, what they're not seeing that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:19.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so bringing that back to sofa, I mean, I'm doing stuff all the time, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I have the website, I make a press kit, you know, we talked about like support pages</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and stuff like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think I actually think there's an overabundance of content for any developers around</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">code, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Which is great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't need to contribute to that, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because my code ain't going to help anybody, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a way better people for that. But when it comes to like kind of your kind of product</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:52.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">infrastructure, right, and how you do things and how you can scale yourself to be a little</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:59.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">bit bigger than just one person, I think that stuff's really interesting. And I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:05.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, I have ideas and opinions here that I think are worth sharing and people can learn</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">from." Like you can take, just take a little nugget that you like from the video and</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">use it. You know, that's fine. You don't have to use all</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. It's kind of like, it's like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">getting to work with somebody. Yeah. In the sense that, uh, like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so much of what I know how to do professionally is because I</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">worked with people, at least I used to work with people in the</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">same space and you just see how they do things and like, yeah,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">your people's thought processes as you go. Um, and especially in</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:38.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the indie scene, but even on top of that in the like, indie marketing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:44.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">running a business, whatever you want to call that world, most of us are doing that much</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">more insular from the world, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like Twitter was pretty much the only space where I feel like I ever saw that kind of stuff</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">really talked about, like a press kit.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">People might talk about it there, but see, like I feel like you're a video, I got like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a dozen things from that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I literally have some notes from when I watch that one where I'm like, ooh,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or not notes, but I threw it into my feedback for me.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I mean, like the idea of using Notion, like of course,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I knew that that's a thing you could do.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And when I first, like when you first brought up that you use Notion for</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">your press kit, I was like, oh, that's kind of a clever idea,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but like I have a system that kind of works well for me.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But then there was a couple more things that you said,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">where I was like, hmm, maybe I should really consider that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then by the end of it, I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all right, I'm adding a task to research.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like, what would it be like to switch this over to notion</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or craft or one of those?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Because it solved a couple little problems.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, I knew that existed</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because people have talked about stuff like that on Twitter.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But watching you and hearing you talk through</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">why you did it is a big part of,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, what sort of got my brain chugging on that idea.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I love that kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's cool, man.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I mean, I've ideas for tons more videos like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I never want to be like preachy with stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's just more like, hey, this is what I did.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Here's why I did it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And if it's helpful for you, great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because everyone's situation's different.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it may not be a one-to-one match for what people need.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I do think that you might say, OK, that's</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's great for developers and stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think people are just interested though, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like people use apps all the time,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but they have no clue where it comes from.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They don't know who makes them.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They don't know what's involved.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think like one of my longterm ideas</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with the YouTube stuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause the YouTube channel is like crazy small, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like it's, and that's totally fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But the longterm idea is that, okay,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm asking people to pay real money for this thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they have no idea who I am.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And they may not even know, they may think,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like we hear the joke all the time,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like everyone thinks just Apple makes all the apps, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:15.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So I have intentionally and uncomfortably put my face</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in different parts of the app</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and like the marketing stuff and with the YouTube channel.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">More is a way to show that like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there's like a real person here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's not just like some big companies</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">just trying to like cash grab stuff</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and look at all the work that I do for this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like this is, this takes time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This takes a lot of effort.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I mean gang, 35 bucks a year is not expensive.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm sorry, it's just not like it's not.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, that's a hill I will die on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's interesting like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause I do the same kind of thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like a lot of my support requests</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and even reviews a lot of times will literally call me up</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">by name, they'll be like, hey Charlie,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or Charlie's a great, you know, whatever.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Which is awesome when it's possible.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But like, I always wonder, like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've talked to a lot of people on the show</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about this exact thing where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there's a point whenever you're doing a thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">on the side in our community.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Most people using it at first are probably gonna be,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">other people in our community because that's who you reach right but if you start getting traction</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:39.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">on the store the majority of people that are downloading your app you got that acquisition through</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the app store like there's no other than good your website they don't know who you are on twitter</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">i doubt that they're on their your youtube page so like yeah do you also integrate</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know your face or your name or anything like that in the app itself</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:01.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, in the settings page, like if you scroll the bottom, my very beautiful face is there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay, so you're just saying the face is there. I didn't know this before.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:11.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's small enough so that I look better. If it was bigger, it would be horrifying.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:20.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, just sotaways. And again, that's also like kind of buried. It's like in settings,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all the at the bottom, right? Which is fine. Right? Again, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to like hit people over the head with this. But for those that are kind of curious, it can be</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">helpful. Most people would probably not going to care though, you know, which is fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:43.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right. It's nice whenever that stuff's surrounding the parts where they start like trying to solve</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a problem. Like if you can find the areas where people are frustrated and at those points make it</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">more obvious that it's a single human being behind this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like maybe that helps.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's true.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like you just said it, like people say, call you out by name, like, oh, hey, Charlie,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">people do it to me too through supporting males.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think it's nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, cause like they know it's me, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's not, it's not like to whom it may be, may concern, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Kind of thing or like, dear company, it's like, hey, Sean, there's this problem.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Can you please help me?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, there's definitely a different voice</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in support emails when somebody realizes your person.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'Cause I also get support emails that'll be like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">referencing the team or you all, or you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Words like that where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, this person thinks I'm a company company.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then when I respond, I'm a little more,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I mean, I'm always pretty personal</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause usually I'm trying to reply on my phone</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">while my kids are brushing their teeth or something.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah. And like the next reply that you get back, you know, if the person's angry or whatever,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:00.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is usually a lot more, uh, human, if that makes sense, 100%. It's a great way to defuse</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">any kind of tension that's there. You know, I imagine there's arguments for the other way in</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">terms of, especially depending on the type of app that you're building. If, if you want the trust</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">of being a company and not sure an individual, because there's an assumption you make whenever</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you download software and it's like, oh, this is some guy in their mom's basement or whatever</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">making this. And you kind of have an idea in your head of what level of support and quality</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you should get out of this. But I guess if the app speaks for itself, then by the time they've</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:36.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">gotten to the point of realizing your person, they already know that this is an app with the</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">quality that you've already presented. And there's like, you know, most people don't write in,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right, like there's also like, there's the selection of folks who actually take time to it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is awesome. But most people, if they run into an issue or if they have a question,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they probably just like, I guess I can't figure this out. I guess it's broken, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then they just like put it away. I struggled for a long time figuring out how to do your</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like my signature at the end of an email that's like a genuine support this person's having</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">joy. Because it always feels weird saying thanks with an exclamation point, Charlie,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:17.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, salutations felt a little too formal. Yeah. And what I kind of landed on most of the time</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:26.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is thanks for reaching out in it. That wording that you just made of like most people don't reach out</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I want to signal like I'm really grateful that you didn't just bail or leave a bad review.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:38.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You actually pinged me. Yes. And so that that's kind of why like probably nobody that gets my</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">emails care is what the signature is, but it makes it easier for me to send them now,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">having that kind of at the end of most of them.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:52.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah. I've been doing, if it's a super sofa subscriber who emails me,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:59.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll say every time. Thanks for your support every time. So, and like, because it's true,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">thank you. Like, that's amazing that, dude, isn't it weird that like, you made something and someone</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">bought it? Like someone speaks money? Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:14.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've said that on the show too, but when support email gets heavy, which I'm in a phase right</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">now where it's a little heavier, I don't have this feeling admittedly, but there are times where</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:26.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll get it a so pretty mail that in iOS 16 or in iOS dot update broke something or even an</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">update that I pushed out broke something and it'll happen right after one of those things happened.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:37.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">My initial feeling is usually not like, "Oh, I gotta go fix this." It's like somebody noticed</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, yeah, there's a human being.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's like these numbers, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, that is actually like a really nice feeling,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">surprisingly.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh, it's amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like someone cares enough to even like write an email.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's just, it's so nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, even the, I haven't gotten like a super mean one,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but the ones that are maybe a little,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there's a little, a little aggressiveness behind it, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Hey, thanks for writing it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's cool.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You care enough to get mad.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's cool, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I even had to deal with the like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the really angry thing, but I'm very girded up for it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">preparing for this subscription switch,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because usually the most,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't know how to phrase this,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">hostel is not the right word, but like, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The ones that make me feel a little tense</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">are usually the ones that are like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Thank you so much for not being one of the horrible,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">mean and re-terrible, awful, money-grabbing developers that use the subscriptions. And</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm kind of like, "Oh no, I hear it."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:51.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's a threat, isn't it? And they're probably not meeting it that way, you know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:56.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But it always feels that way to me like, you're going to come back for me, aren't you?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I mean, they might. Right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Well, hopefully they won't. Because I'm not going to like, take it away from somebody</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:06.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who's already paid. But yeah, how are you doing with all that? Is that getting close, you</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm always afraid I'm going to turn this into me talking about my things show.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So you're fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I tried not to.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Well, people aren't here for me though.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They're here for you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's not true.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But no, I'm a decent ways into it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:34.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There was a bunch of company, my job-by-job stuff that all kind of got crazy for a little</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">bit that was making me really drive on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a lot of these things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I bet.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And so I'm on the other side of that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and now the job of jobs,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">taking a little bit more of my brain power.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I've slowed down a little bit,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but probably my top priority right now is to</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">get that switch taken care of.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'Cause it's a way of having a way on my brain</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and also I keep hearing things from people like you saying.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just wish I had switched it sooner</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I'm like, I've already made the decision now.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just wanted to be switched over</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and to deal with these consequences.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I work very slowly deliberately.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I said, why is the word I use?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But really what I mean is scared,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">scaredly.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The fear is real.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh my God.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The fear of messing things up of bugs of,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">yeah, any of that stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm a very slow developer,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I'm slower than you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's brutal.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like sometimes I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"What am I even like?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">How'd I make it here?"</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, like how did I get here?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- It's crazy how like continually working on something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:44.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">when you look back, you've traveled forward.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, (laughs)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah. - Like walking really slowly</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for multiple years still gets you somewhere.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yes. - And that's the thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's been weird with, I think,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it maybe you've experienced this too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:03.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but like by being so public about what I'm working on,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's sort of this natural driver to like get back</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to the thing that people in my head know me for.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And because of that, even when I'm in like the down times</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">where I'm just not moving or anything,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm still just like plugging away at little tickets</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I can pull or little small things I can do.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:30.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then when those iOS updates come out or new features</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or whatever happened, then I kind of pull it together</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and get a couple of features all at once.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But then yeah, when you look back on it,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you're like, you know, I actually did make some stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Didn't I?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like this is moving forward.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's not as stagnant as it feels like in my head.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, just, I mean, just showing up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like just show up regularly</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you'll make progress.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And if it's like a little bit set of time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with the-- - Oh, you get the tangents.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(laughs)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- So there was a couple other things</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I did wanna talk about.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So we talked about the YouTube channel.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't even know if we talked about why you started.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah, we did.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a lot about why you started the YouTube channel.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But there's a couple of other things that you've talked about.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">One of them is doing some paid sponsorships advertisements</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for different things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like there was some podcasts that you did last year.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm curious, well, again, why you chose to do that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then how it went?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:45.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So marketing is like, I feel like this podcast is great,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because I've got to hear so many other developers talk</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about stuff like this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I feel like marketing is the one thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that keeps coming up is like, yeah,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this is like, I don't really know what to do,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or it's really hard and all that stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And also, just getting attention is just so hard.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, because everyone is screaming for attention.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like everybody, whether it's on Twitter,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">just social media or whatever.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:28.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And the realization I came to is that the market is so saturated in terms of apps that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:36.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm going to have to pay for some attention as opposed to earning it from scratch.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just kind of accept that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'm okay with it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">businesses have to pay to advertise.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's kind of how it works, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's pretty normal, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">If you go to like any local business in your town,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they're like, yeah, we have to advertise.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I don't really know what's problem, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's how it works.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:50:54.920 --> 00:51:00.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The reason I wanted to start with podcasts is</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">when I was thinking about the sponsors</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or the ads that I have come across</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in different media, whether it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't really see YouTube ads anymore</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because I have YouTube premium,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but whether it was YouTube or on Twitter</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or like Instagram ads are amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like there, because you're always like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Oh, that looks good, looks good."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But the stuff that I always valued was,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a lot of it comes from podcast to be honest with you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There's something about hearing the host read it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It just hits different.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It just does.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so that's why I wanted to do that and start there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And again, I'd never written ad copy before.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I was like, okay, I have to write ad copy.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I went back and I was like really listening to ads</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in a different way than I was before.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:51:53.840 --> 00:52:01.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, and I picked a few Apple centric podcasts</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like Connected,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">focused the talk show at the end of the year, sponsored.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I actually even sponsored Daring Fireball over the summer, like the site.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, the website.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So this is going to sound weird, but like I'm ever thinking, I was like, oh, one day I want</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to sponsor that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, like many of us read Daring Fireball for years.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I just like, oh, yeah, I want to do that one day.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I did it over the summer.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It was great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And sponsoring the talk show was great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And all the other podcasts was great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:43.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think the way I'm thinking of it is it's not like direct advertising or like direct</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">response where I'm expecting immediate returns on this stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:54.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because if you think about a lot of products that you come across or a lot of brands,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you just you get hit with so much stuff now that you may actually need to hear something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:05.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a few times or come across something a few times before you actually do anything about</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So there's a name for that, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Is that brand advertising or brand advertising?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Okay, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- That's like Coca-Cola is sponsoring a skateboarding event</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or something and it's like obviously,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they don't have a special URL</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that everybody that goes to that event is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">going to cocacola.com/extreme</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and they can directly attribute that,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but it's like getting their name more well known, I guess.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, just keeping it in people's minds.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That kind of stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But for me, I'm literally starting from zero.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Nobody knows who so far is and who I am.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:51.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So my approach to this is definitely more long term.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:58.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I am very happy with how everything performed this year</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in terms of ROI.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Let's talk about ROI, bro.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's probably the word I hate the most</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is the word or why.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, it's a tragedy in your head.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I like Roy.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, Roy is fun.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Do they have a Roy?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- If we can say a little bit, we can say Roy.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- You're pulling out the weird ones.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, okay, let's talk about EBITDA.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so, and the podcast stuff is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's like a form of brain advertising and direct response.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:34.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">We're like, I did say, hey, go to SophageQ.com/thetalkshow,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:34.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm able to see some metrics from that, but it's also not a guarantee that people will go click</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">on it, right? Because they might just go to the app store or they might just not do anything.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">How did you, I mean, I won't ask specifics. Just, I don't know if you don't want to like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:54.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">call out certain shows or whatever, but like, did you like, did you feel like at least some of those</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:59.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they paid for themselves? Or was that an investment? That's a long-term thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm trying to think because I don't want to, I don't want to say this in a way that like makes any</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:11.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">other show looked bad. Sure, right. I would say in the aggregate, everything paid for itself</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:19.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and more. So yeah, so it was it was well worth it and I planned to do more of it in 2023.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:25.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's interesting. So do you have in your head or not in your head in written down somewhere?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I should know the I should know the acronym for this off the top of my head, but how much</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:38.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">user is worth. Oh, like the lifetime value. The LTV. Yeah, there we go.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:45.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">My LTV. Yeah. Lg. We're going to a real business podcast here. I know. Look at us.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I should go get a Patagonia vest. Put that on. There you go.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:55.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">With a nice time. Or Miami. Yeah. There's the two options. I think. Yeah. Oh,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:01.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that sounds good. Um, yeah. So I, so there's a couple of metrics that I track. Um,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:09.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">LTV is not one yet, most of because I've only had subscriptions for a year and a half.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right. How could you know? Yeah. Yeah. So I feel like there's a number there, but I don't</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:20.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">think it's accurate to accurate enough to really track at this point. So the metrics that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I really look at are the monthly recurring revenues for MMR and ARR annual recurring revenue</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then active subscribers. Like those are the things that I'm actively looking at</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">daily. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Because that's like a thing that's, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:42.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a difference with advertising, a subscription versus like I feel like I'm playing on easy mode</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in a lot of these, uh, the little bit of advertising stuff that I mess with because it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:54.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there is a literal, very clear fixed dollar amount that each, uh, customer is worth to me. And I</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">can tell you, yeah, yeah, basically up to that number. And I'm at least making money. Have you done</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Matt?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just used the like the App Store ads.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, how good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, how's that go?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, okay, so I don't know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like I just described the situation of, oh, it's easy because I can just set.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay, my app is $9.99.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:23.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, 15% off from Apple's cut and then, you know, a little bit because I want</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">some profit margin.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's like I'm willing to pay like $7 or something.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't remember what I have said that,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I get some amounts and it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if I make a sale and that's how they charge for the app store,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's not like they click the link</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then you have to get a conversion.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's literally, I'm paying for the ad</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if they download the app.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And in my case, them download the app is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they are paying for the app.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- That actually makes a lot of sense for you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- The thing is, I've noticed that I will have</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:03.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">big spikes in how many sales I get through ads, whenever I have big sales in or big</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">spikes in sales from other means.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:11.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like if I'm on a podcast or I'm featured on the App Store or somebody writes about</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">me in a blog or something, I'll also get a conspicuous spike in ad sales.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I don't understand if it's, I think what's happening is people search dark noise</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then a Dark Noise ad shows.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so then they click the ad and it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they were my customer already at that point.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- But now I just gave Apple, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">60% of my sale on that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And so I don't know, I haven't done the work</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to figure out if that is accurate</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or if that's just, this is my hot trade based on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- A sudden big bill from ads on the same days</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I think I've earned a lot of sales on my own.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But it certainly seems like there's that element to it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it feels like an easy calculation,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I think I'm actually still overpaying.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I don't know if I should be smarter</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about how I do that or how you avoid that</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or if you just can't avoid that problem.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But do you just have that on like all the time?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, so it's better.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- There's like multiple versions of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">how the app store does their ads.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but the like, I think the one I use is the basic one still.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think they have it a basic in advance.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But because of my situation being paid upfront,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">having that really simple filter of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you can just automatically bid me</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you're gonna do it based on, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">likelihood that the person will click the ad</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because that makes Apple money and then,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then that benefits me, the benefits Apple,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like it kind of works out,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but then there's those couple situations.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I almost wish I could remove,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and maybe the advanced ones I could.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:57.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like if I could remove the keyword my actual app name,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which funnily enough,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like most developers,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's their complaint is that they have to buy ads</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">for their ad name so that competitors don't do the same.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- But I almost wonder if it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if they're searching for my ad name,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I have a high intent customer right there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that customer's worth way less</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">then add for that customer's work,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the way less to me than somebody else</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because they're probably already coming for me.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And are they really gonna get distracted</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and click on somebody else?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't know, maybe they would.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm throwing a bunch of things out here</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with no actual research on this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So take none of this as,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">try it in true advice here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, I mean, it takes a lot of work</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to measure that stuff too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah, yeah, you kind of need infrastructure</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to do that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So that's I I feel</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:52.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Maybe it's the sub do you know the sub club podcast? Yes, so club is great</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because yeah, they actually know what they're talking about</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:02.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Around all these topics. Yeah. Yeah. I remember I forget who the guest was but he was saying like oh yeah</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like if you have like a small marketing budget</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then like David Bernard like stop them. So can you define small please? Yeah</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he's like yeah like 20,000 and I was like</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, bro, that ain't small, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, okay, maybe for like a bigger company.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Make sure I get a big, sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'Cause, and he was like, yeah, for indie developers,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">20 grand to spend on ads is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that's a big ask right there, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's such, like, it's such a scary,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even if you figure out one of those magical,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">fun old things where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I put $1 in and I get $2 out.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right, it's like, if you have a whole bunch of money</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that you're willing to lose, then sure, pour $50,000 into that bucket and get $100,000</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:57.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">out. But sure, if you don't have $50,000 that you're willing to just throw away if you</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">did something wrong, it's like that is really scary.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, that's what, yeah, and I think the podcast stuff is much better. I think another</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:11.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">benefit of the podcast stuff, sponsorship, especially with like the podcast that I did sponsor</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">was I also felt like I've gotten so much value from those podcasts personally.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I'm like, you know what? I'm happy to do this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:29.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I'm happy to sponsor this because I love these shows and I've been listening for</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">years and it's like this is great. You know, like I feel like it's almost like a</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">wave also giving back. It's not charity. I know that, but it's like that's also</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like a factor with those things too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And I mean, it's kind of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even though most of the time,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this isn't what it actually means,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the term sponsor, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's kind of the idea is like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in a way you're like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I want this to keep going.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And also I want to benefit too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And like this benefits both of us.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, there's a couple shows I have on my radar</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in the same kind of vein where I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you know, even if it doesn't work out,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:14.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just really like the people that run this in this show and it's been a lot to me.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, no, that's a good point.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that's a good reason to pick a show you like.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like in your case with SOFA, especially, your target market has to be,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">not has to be.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm guessing is the exact type of people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Apple-oriented productivity type people who are more likely to be listening to.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">more likely to be listening to a daring fireball or connected or something like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:49.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Are also more likely to be the type of people who want to dedicated rich apple integration</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">type app for tracking their movies and TV shows and podcasts.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And video games.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And board games.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Video games.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Books.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And books.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Forgetting one.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There might be another one in there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">There's a lot.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I agree.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think it's a good fit.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think long-term it can definitely expand out.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:25.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And there can be ways to -- it's actually like a weirdly hard product to talk about because</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">if you think I could go super specific and just talk about books, right, or just talk</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about video games, or I can go more broad, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and say, "It helps you be more intentional</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"with your downtime and helps you organize your downtime."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I love that, that phrasing by the way.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You say organizing your downtime,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but the one I really like is the be more intentional</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about your downtime.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">No, yeah, you're right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It, that came out of writing the ad copy for the sponsors.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, interesting.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like to me, I've already gotten other benefits</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">out of this where I wouldn't have sat down</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and wrote any of that stuff without this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it made me think about the product in different ways.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I've always called it like a downtime organizer,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which it is.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, this phrase of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it helps you be more intentional with your downtime</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because hey, however you want to use your downtime is cool.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like if you want to just go on YouTube and watch stuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">fine, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">If you want to go for a run, that's cool too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like whatever, however you want to use your downtime is fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But just be more intentional about it, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Be intentional with like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm gonna do 'em scroll for 20 minutes or an hour.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">If that's what you need,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like when we buy bags of Doritos here,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like I eat the whole bag 'cause it tastes really good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I know in an hour it's gonna be rough, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But you made that you were intentional about it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">100% intentional.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I knew, like I'll say it about what I have to like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this is a bad idea, but I'm doing it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like this is something probably a lot of people</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:05.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">listening to this, if they're also sort of indie on the side,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">working on things type people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:10.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I know a lot of my friends are the same way where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">we struggle with relaxing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's not that we're always productive.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's that when we have time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I know for me, when I'm in a rough spell</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:27.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with dark noise in particular, launch this easier</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because it's editing and doing this is like a,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it pulls you through the process, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I don't have a choice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I come out with a thing every other week</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it pulls me through.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But with dark noise that you have to,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you have to show up like you said earlier</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and like do the thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And sometimes I'm just like work depressed</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">where I'm just like, I know I'm not gonna get</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">anything done tonight,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I'm so frustrated that I haven't accomplished anything</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the last couple of days.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll just open my laptop to wheel myself to do something.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'll just stare at it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then the day will be over and I'm like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:04.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I should have played a game or watched a episode of whatever</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with my wife because that's a thing that I enjoy.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I'm not doing, instead, I'm just making myself feel bad.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's so hard.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:16.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then you get into-- and this is where something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like Sofa really comes into play, where you are like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all right, I'm taking the tonight off.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then it feels so precious.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:26.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like anybody with kids will know this feeling too of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:28.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- You have the night off,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause grandma has the kids and you're like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all right, every single thing we do</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">has to be the best version that we've ever done.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- All this, Pranet.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, yeah, you can't pick a restaurant</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you're trying to pick the best restaurant.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then you spend an hour, you finally pick one,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but you're not neither person satisfied with it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then you call up and they're like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">yeah, we don't have a table</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause it's already seven o'clock.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And you're like, what did I do?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And having a list of,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">hey, these are some movies I wanna watch.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I have two hours I could watch a movie and just pick one from that list.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's, it's, it's, it's like the most first world of problems to describe,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but my goodness doesn't make a big difference.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:12.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And you actually do the thing that you wanted to with your downtime.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Almost like when, like when you explain it, it's like, that's it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like that's the idea.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like, yeah, it's pretty simple.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know, it's like, it's amazing how just keeping a list of something can be a</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:32.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">great tool because watching a movie is so much better than scrolling Netflix for the same</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">amount of time that you could have watched the movie.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Now Blockbuster, that's different.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:42.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I would argue that the time I spent walking up and down the aisles and Blockbuster back</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in the day, that was valuable intentional time, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Dude, that's a great, that's a great like comparison.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I never thought about that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:53.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But yeah, going to Blockbuster was, that was awesome.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That'd be like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It was a good Friday night, Saturday night. Like, yes, we're gone the blockbuster.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:58.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, my God.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">When you were in pants, right? You're not in your living room.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Wait, are you wearing this right now? Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The benefit of zoom, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I thought this was the no pants podcast. No.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:18.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">No, this is not a Curtis Herbert's show.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">What was it called? What was it?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I forget to, but I know you're talking about.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:29.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm struggling. But anyway, no, I am wearing pants just so we're all clear here. Blockbuster.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:34.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, blackfuster. Blackfuster. Good times. Man, I know instead of like three times</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this episode, but you are really getting late night ramblings. Yeah, I like it. I like it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:43.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Make it weird, man. You know? Yeah, sure. Just get weird with it. It's good to have these</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:49.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">every once in a while. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So podcast sponsorships. Good. Good for lots of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, you feel like the role was good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The EBITDA, DUD, it's EBITDA.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it was EBITDA all day.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- No, I think that's the main thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Other things that you do as far as marketing goes,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like SOFA has a,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like it has that presence.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And maybe this is brand marketing is kind of how it gets there,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but it's like, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">In my head, it's sort of like it is the app for this space</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I think of when I think, oh, I want to track some new thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like, that's where I could think about it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And of course, your website is beautiful.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Anybody who wants to make a like app a website.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">One, prepare yourself.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You're not probably, if you're not a designer,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">you're probably not gonna pull off what you've done</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">over probably a long period of time with sofaHQ.com.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but yeah, it's just ripe with ideas you can steal.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll just say that 'cause steal, I've certainly stole</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">an idea from it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh my God, I've never had an original idea</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in my life like everything is stolen, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, you know, you've seen that video</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">everything's a remix, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that's kind of a good idea.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- I mean, but it's so true, like you just build on each other</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even if you have no idea you're doing that, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's totally fine.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Steelway, you're good.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Right, we're talking about generative AI now, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay, I'm gonna stop that tangent before I start going down that one.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, that could be, yeah, that's quite a topic that we could go very deeply.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Well, the last episode was literally about that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I just wasn't that too nice the other day.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Nice.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yes.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I told you, I'm fan of the show, man.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's a good show.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I like it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So before I wrap up, there was one other little thing I had in here, which is like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I guess this is really a marketing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So we'll just say this is part of that same topic.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Do you find yourself counter positioning</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to what the big players in each of these spaces are doing?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So like, 'cause like you have movie tracking</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and there's obviously like IMDB or letterbox gear,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">something like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Or like Goodreads for books or something like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Or do you kind of treat it like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">no, this is a totally separate thing from those.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This is sort of an all in one place for all of your stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, I'm just curious how you approach that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't want this to sound rude at all.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't mean this to be rude in any way, shape, or form,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but I really don't pay attention to those apps.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The person that I have in mind,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and the person that I am kind of thinking that sofa</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is really for, is the person who is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they're already keeping these lists.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they already do this, but they use Apple notes, or reminders.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And it's like, hey, that's cool.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That's cool, you're doing it, but this is way better.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">This is so much better than that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And that's the person that I'm really focused on,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because I think the type of,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">when I think about the type of app that I think so if it is,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:17.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or I want it to be aspirationally. I think it's like this weird mix between the kind of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:24.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like simplicity and the experience of something like Apple notes, but to have the power</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:31.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and the flexibility of something like a spreadsheet. And I love spreadsheets. Like for people</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:37.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who know spreadsheets, like they understand like why people love spreadsheets because they're</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Right. - Infinitely flexible,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you can kind of do anything in there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, spreadsheets literally run the world.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, the world runs on spreadsheets.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's unbelievable.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But the experience of like editing those spreadsheets,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, it kind of sucks, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like, you gotta set everything up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like very tedious.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I'm trying to, I think there's this middle ground</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">between like a great design</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and great experience of using the thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">without it feeling like this big intimidating spreadsheet,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but it also has a ton of flexibility.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So that's really what I'm going for.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And there's a lot of people today</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.680</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who track the stuff in spreadsheets, too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right? - Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And like, you can go on YouTube,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">people make these amazing spreadsheets of like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">here's all the books I read this year,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it has all these stats and stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like it's so, it's amazing, so incredible.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I'm more interested in the person who is tracking stuff</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in Apple Notes today and the person who's making</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">a custom spreadsheet.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think those are really interesting</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and long-term I'd like to kind of bridge the gap there.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think those other services, they're awesome.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And they're for very specific people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But I don't really see so fast competing with them.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I see them as more of like maybe a companion</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in different ways, you know?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.480</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So that makes sense.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Cool.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:11.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Okay. Well, before I wrap this up then,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll ask you the question I ask everybody in the show,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is what is a person or people out there</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that have inspired you that you'd recommend</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">others check out?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, I have a list.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I have perfect five people, five people.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So first person is, this guy's actually,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">he was the original developer on sofa,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">so Oliver Fepher.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's an amazing, amazing iOS developer.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's still, we're great friends.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And the amount that I have learned from him</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">over the years is just incredible.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The dude's super smart.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he's one of those people who's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.440</p>

<p class="transcript-line">is not like, he's not very active</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">on social media, like you're not going to see all these posts from him and stuff like that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And there's so many people like that who are just killing it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They're just like so good at what they do, but they don't necessarily talk about what</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040</p>

<p class="transcript-line">they do, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The Twitter is not real life.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Me and Twitter, 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, 100%.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But like I just, I've learned so much from him and still continue to learn so much from</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">him.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.520</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So he's amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The next four people are, the reason I want to highlight these people are because they</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:33.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">are the people I learned the most from when I was first starting out with iOS development</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">back in 2017.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So Meng Tu of Design and Code.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:47.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So he was like the perfect bridge for me because he's a designer.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He knew how to explain development concepts to a designer.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.240</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm like, oh yeah, thank you.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.080</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You now understand how delegation works, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like that makes total sense now, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.640</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Whereas before I'm like, I have no idea</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">what this even means, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So his stuff is amazing, design and code.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he's still doing great work.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.760</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Mark Moykins, I don't know if I'm saying his name correctly,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but he has a YouTube channel, Big Mountain Studio.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think he does a lot like SwiftUI stuff now,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but also someone who has good,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.280</p>

<p class="transcript-line">good way of explaining things to beginners</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.320</p>

<p class="transcript-line">when it comes to iOS development,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">'cause I'm sure there's a lot of people</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.960</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who listen to the show who are like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"I wanna do this, like I wanna do iOS development."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And these are great people to, to like, learn from.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.120</p>

<p class="transcript-line">They have tons of free content out there and stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.800</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Sean Allen is another one.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.000</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's another one on YouTube.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:45.920</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Great stuff.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:52.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">First, very, literally when I was told that I could switch over</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.160</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to an iOS team in 2018, well, this would have been the end of 2018.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I was like, this is amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm so excited.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.600</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I need to figure out what any of it is.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I downloaded Xcode, went to Breadco, which is Panera,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but St. Louis here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And--</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:10.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">OK.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's called--</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:19.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Long story. The very first thing I watched was the Sean Allen video and I don't why but it was it was about whether </p>you`should have it was storyboards versus

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:23.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, yeah, like like developing it was the word I</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:30.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Didn't know what storyboards were or what you I could what well, I probably knew what you I could was at that point</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.560</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But like that was the level of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.840</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Basicness that I had in that video like it sounds silly, but it's like it established</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:42.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, this is a debate in the world and like that it was so helpful</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah also hard second on Sean Allen there</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:51.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, yeah great stuff and the last one is I mean you've heard this one a million times but like Paul Hudson just</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">The number of times his site still comes out when like I search</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Swift stuff is just like wild</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:04.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, just another he just he knows how to explain stuff to people and</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yeah, so I'm just so thankful to all these people because</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:17.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I you know, so for wouldn't exist without them to be honest. So very very thankful for that. Yeah, and </p>you're`contributing to that

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">sort of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:25.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">broad ecosystem of things, you know learning watching people work</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like you said Paul Hudson I feel like his</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">live streams that he does are</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Yes, the closest I've ever gotten to</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:39.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">to the first job I had with iOS, we did pairing like all the time.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.400</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I got to literally just sit with somebody</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">who actually knew what they were doing and like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">"Ah, that's awesome."</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Watch how they moved the cursor around.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You know what I mean?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like it's those little things that you just,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">books don't teach you that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And even most tutorials that are trying to teach you</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">about concepts, that's not what they're focused on</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because like why would they be?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But Paul Hudson's live streams,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I know other people do these too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:08.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">surprisingly amazing because you're like, what did he just do?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he's like, fumble, he had a typo or something</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and then he fixed it this certain way</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you're like, whoa.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">That kind of stuff I feel like is super valuable too.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, learning through video,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:23.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like you're hitting on it, like so many articles</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">will either, you know, maybe inadvertently</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or do it on purpose, make assumptions</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I don't need to say this thing</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because this person will know.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:33.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.880</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And then you go, I feel like I'm missing something here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I don't really get it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But when you have to watch someone do a video,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's harder to, for them to just skip over it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like they have to do it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So the video stuff is great.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Right.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Well, and it's a delicate balance, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Because it's like, when you do know those things,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">it's infuriating sitting through a video</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">of somebody doing that thing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But then when you don't.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So it's like Apple, like WWDC videos are,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like the example of video where it's like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even when they're typing code,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like that is so rehearsed to the point of extremism.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- They're not gonna get any of those things.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- But you also wouldn't want it in that context.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:12.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Do you wanna go another hour on Apple's documentation?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">(laughing)</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Lack of content.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Oh my goodness.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:22.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I think what you meant was hacking with Swift.com.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's a wonderful documentation.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.860</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Incredibly well done.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:31.100</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah, I have weird thoughts about that.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Coming from the Microsoft world,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and I used to complain about MSDN</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:40.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and their documentation and coming over to Apple world,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:44.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">the very first thing was holy cow,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">all of the bloggers and third party people</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in this space are amazing.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like I've never, you go to Hacking with Swift</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and at the top it says,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:58.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">this was updated, last updated two months ago,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and you're like, oh my gosh,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:00.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Like they update their blog.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He was like, what is that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I never experienced that before.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But then I think in part the reason why maybe is</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:11.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">there's a huge gap when it comes to Apple's documentation</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">itself, especially if you're doing the audio APIs</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or some of these older, maybe less loved areas.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Ah, that's a good point.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh, man.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I feel like you're sort of digging through history</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">with Apple Docs a lot of times,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because you open up a page and you're like,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">oh, this is from this era,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">because it's a totally different design</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it looks super weird.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And you're like, this one will actually tell me stuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">but most of it will be out of date</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and that's kind of the balancing act.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Oh my, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:50.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm like, I'm trying to resist temptation here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- Ollie a couple years ago.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I remember, I said something like off the cuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like, oh yeah, I did check like crash reports</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">in App Store Connect.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">He's like, why, why are you doing that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You could do it in Xcode.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.460</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I was like, oh, hell.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:09.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And he showed me, I'm like, well, how was I gonna find that?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:13.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">How was I gonna know to go dig into this menu</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:17.220</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and find the organized window?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And then, oh, that's where I get my crash reports.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's like, what?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's just, yeah, there's just like so many,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and it's very big, right?</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.260</p>

<p class="transcript-line">which is fine. - Yeah, it's huge.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.580</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- And old. - Yeah, you know,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">internal. - And old, yeah, totally, yeah.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:33.140</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But there is the education stuff,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.940</p>

<p class="transcript-line">or just general documentation is a little rough, for sure.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.660</p>

<p class="transcript-line">We have a gluttony of options of really high quality</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:44.060</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and polished stuff from not Apple.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.340</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So, you know, yeah. - Agreed.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">- When some you lose some.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">All right, well, I will actually wrap this up.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Thank you to, for you joining the show</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.900</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and for anybody listening who's listened to me ramble</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">through this whole way.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Selfishly, this has been one of these episodes</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">that I just really enjoy because I have a couple of notes</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">even for myself of like, ooh, I should try that after.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I Friday get off this call.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:13.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So yeah, I really appreciate you coming on</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.820</p>

<p class="transcript-line">and this was loads of fun.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:16.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Dude, thanks for having me.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.980</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'm not kidding, I'm genuinely honored to be on this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.380</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I've been listening to this podcast</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">since you first started it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I love it.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:32.620</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's super well done and what you've put together here.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I would say pretty quickly,</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">like it has not been a long time that you've been doing this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And super high quality, great conversations.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.180</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And being a host on something is hard.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.780</p>

<p class="transcript-line">It's really hard.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.540</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And I think you do a great job.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So thank you for continuing to do this.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.020</p>

<p class="transcript-line">And thanks for having me on.</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:58.420</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So I think the only hard part is is convincing smart people to come on and then and then I just get to like poke and </p>let

<p class="time-stamp">01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">All the smart stuff come out. So yeah</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:07.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">So getting somebody like you is the only reason that this whole thing works. So well, I hope I don't lose you</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Subscribers hopefully yeah</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:15.300</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Hopefully the numbers don't go down as long as they stay even for you. The juries are fun. What your Roy will be</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.500</p>

<p class="transcript-line">But we'll see yeah</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.200</p>

<p class="transcript-line">You should do that. You should post everyone's Roy at the end of</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.700</p>

<p class="transcript-line">Just shame people. Yeah, no be brilliant. Yeah. All right. Well, uh</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.740</p>

<p class="transcript-line">I'll let you go, but seriously. Thanks again. This is this is so much fun</p>

<p class="time-stamp">01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:33.340</p>
